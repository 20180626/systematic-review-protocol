- There is a growing consensus in the literature on the applicability 
of thejusadbellumto cyber-attacks that the effects caused by an attack 
should determinewhether the attack constitutes a use of force (Article 
2(4) of the UN Charter) oran armed attack giving rise to self-defence 
(Article 51 of the UN Charter) 

- LeadingAmerican officials like Richard Clarke, the then National 
Coordinator for Security Infrastructure Protection and 
Counter-terrorism with the NationalSecurity Council,2and Leo Panetta, 
the former Director of the CIA and atthat time the US Secretary of 
Defence,3have referred to the threat of a‘cyber [or electronic] Pearl 
Harbour’that is looming over the United States.Many states have set up 
cyber divisions within their armed forces, establishingboth offensive 
and defensive capabilities. 

- Obviously, this matter was not a central concern to the creators of 
the UNCharter or of the Geneva Conventions (even though computers and 
compu-ter-aided espionage played a big role in the Second World War), 
so a muchdebated topic at the moment is how cyber-attacks fit into the 
internationallegal framework of warfare 

-  A plethora of articles and a number of bookshave already been 
written on the applicability ofjus ad bellum(the rules onthe legality 
of a war itself),5ofjus in bello(the rules governing conduct in a 
war),6and some articles have been dedicated to the applicability of 
inter-national criminal law to cyber-attacks. 

- While there is a wide range of different articles and books on this 
topic, andwhile these differ in their methodologies and 
argumentations, there appears tobe one consensus in an overwhelming 
majority of them: what matters for thequalification of an attack under 
international law is not so much related towhich methods were used to 
commit it, but what effect was caused by it. For the purposes of this 
article, this view is referred to as the‘effects doctrine’. 


- At first glance, the doctrine seems entirely logical. If a person 
gets hurt bysomeone else, it is ultimately not important to that 
person whether this wasdone by being pushed down a flight of stairs, 
by being intentionally run overwith a car or by being beaten with a 
cricket bat. What matters would indeedbe the effect–the amount of pain 
and the injuries caused. 

- Journalists already warned about the ‘cyber industrial complex’(or 
variations thereof),178and describe an industrythat is valued at 
between 80 and 150 billion dollars annually. 

- The Tallinn Manual isbecoming an extremely influential document in 
international law, as thevarious cyber policies and the statements by 
politicians set out in this article’s introduction show–an influence 
that is only likely to increase with the recentpublication of the more 
extensive 2.0 version. 

# {hollis2018if}

- The U.S. military currently regards cyberspace as a warfighting 
domain, and the U.S. military currently regards cyberspace as a 
warfighting domain,and the United States is one of at least thirty 
countries building a militarycapacity  to  conduct  offensive  
cyberattacks.

- Of  course,  the  appeal  ofcyber operations for states is 
straightforward: they can be deployed to supplement(or even substitute 
for) traditional means and methods of warfare, such as by dis-rupting  
an  adversary’s  command  and  control  networks,  military-related  
criticalinfrastructure, or weapons capabilities.Further, they can be 
used asymmetrically,giving otherwise weaker states opportunities to 
project power. In certain circum-stances, they might even operate 
preemptively as a decisivefirst-strike capability.

- At the same time, cyber operations can also contain escalation or 
provide a con-sistent  means  of  engagement  with  adversaries  that  
falls  short  of  kinetic  armedconflict.

- That said, a few states have expressed anxiety about adopting 
a“military para-digm”for cyberspace.China and Cuba reportedly refused 
to endorse the right ofself-defense and international humanitarian law 
(IHL) in cyberspace out of a con-cern that doing so would legitimize 
military cyber operations.Given China’sownhighly regarded cyber 
forces, its position may be convenient, if not hypocritical,since  it 
is driven by a desire to preserve its room to maneuver and  develop  
itsown capabilities, rather than by a sincere concern about the 
effects that militaryoperations will have on cyberspace.

# {prescott2011war}

- The recent exponential growth in cyber-attacks against the digital 
infrastructure of governments, economies and militaries has 
potentially catastrophic effects.

- The use of cyberspace for unfriendly purposes by often 
unidentifiable actors against military, industrial and governmental 
digital infrastructure has  grown  exponentially  in  recent years.

- The  US Department  of  Defense  (DoD)  has stated  that  its  
computer  systems  are scanned  by  potentially  hostile  actors over 
a million times a day and actually probed over a thousand times daily.

- In discussing  attacks  on  NATO  computer systems, NATO Secretary 
General Anders Fogh  Rasmussen  has  stated:  ‘It’s  no exaggeration 
to say that cyber-attacks have become a new form of permanent, 
low-level warfare’.

- Exploitation of national and international network vulnerabilities 
by malicious actors has the potential for catastrophic effects that 
would ordinarily result only from the use of armed force on a 
significant scale.

-  Not surprisingly, technologically  advanced  militaries and 
civilian governmental agencies are continuing  to  develop  
capabilities  to operate offensively in cyberspace.

- The United States’ assessment is that more than thirty ‘countries 
are creating cyber units  for  their  militaries’.

- Also,  not surprising  given  the  rapidity  of  cyber-technology 
advances, the development of the legal and policy constructs 
consistent with  international  humanitarian  law (IHL), which would 
guide the proper use of  these  capabilities,  appears  to  have 
lagged  behind.

- n  2011,  the  US  released  four documents  that  deal  with  the  
use of  force  in  cyberspace:  the  Obama administration’s  
International  Strategy for  Cyberspace  (hence  International 
Strategy),  published  on  16  May; the  DoD’s  Strategy  for  
Operating  in Cyberspace (DoD Strategy), published on 14 July; a 
report by the US Government Accountability  Office  (GAO),  Defense 
Department Cyber Efforts (Cyber Efforts report), released 26 July; and 
finally, the DoD Cyber Policy Report, made public on 14 November.

- Whilst necessary for national security reasons, classification makes 
the open and critical discussion of IHL’s application to situations 
involving cyberspace  much  more  difficult  than discussing the law’s 
application in the physical  world. 

- Different  nations  have different  IHL  training  programmes  for 
their forces, different capabilities, and different domestic legal and 
policy drivers that govern the way in which the use of armed force is 
actually applied.

- Further, even though they must be consistent with IHL, details of 
the rules of engagement are classified.

- Finally, the means by which force in the geophysical world is 
employed, both in terms of tactics and equipment, are well understood 
by many even if they have not been involved in their military use. 
Conversely, the rapid evolution of cyber-technology and its novel 
ability to achieve effects akin to those generated by the use of more 
traditional forms of armed force would likely make it difficult to 
describe the practical application of IHL to cyberspace, even if its 
most important aspects were not classified.

- Bridging the gap between the classified cyber communities and the 
public to foster understanding of which legal norms and policies 
regarding the use of force are applicable is crucial to ensure 
transparency and critical assessment of this vitally important area to 
the greatest extent possible.

# {saxon2016violations}

- Cyber operations allow non-state actors, with relatively minimal 
effort, to pro-duce state-level violence during armed conflict.

- Fortunately, international legalnorms that guide the behaviour of 
states, groups and individuals during peaceand conflict also apply in 
cyberspace. The precise contours of the application,however,  remain  
undefined.

- The  latestgeneration of malware includes cyberweapons with 
extraordinary sophisticationand  capabilities,  including  the  
ability  to  operate  undetected  ‘in  the  wild’  ofcyberspace for 
extended periods of time. Indeed, the science of cyberweapontechnology 
is so complex that contemporary military commanders may possessonly a 
limited understanding of how these weapons function.

- Much  about  cyberwarfare  challenges  our  understanding  of  armed 
 conflict10and  the  application  of  international  humanitarian  
law.  Unlike  kinetic  weaponsystems,  cyberweapons  are  not  
machines  composed  of  many  physical  compo-nents; they are 
collections of data used to communicate instructions to softwareor  
hardware.11In  addition  to  their  technical  complexity,  one  
starkly  evidentquality  of  cyberweapons  is  (ironically)  their  
invisibleness.  This  characteristicof  software  code,  combined  
with  the  vast  anonymity  and  ‘interconnectivity’12of cyberspace, 
presents profound challenges  for the prosecution  of 
individualsresponsible for war crimes committed with cyberweapons.

- The authors of theTallinn Manualobserved that ‘the application of 
the law ofarmed  conflict  to  cyber  operations  can  prove  
problematic’.

- The particularly challenging char-acteristics of cyberspace and 
cyberweapons demand new thinking, and new fo-rensic techniques, for 
investigating and proving criminal responsibility. As 
cybertechnologies—both benign and malevolent—continuously evolve, the 
technicaland  legal  skills  of  prosecutors  and  investigators  must 
 also  develop  apace.

# {dinstein2012principle}

- Computer Network Attacks (CNAs) do not automatically come within the 
frame-work of the definition of ‘attack’ in conformity with the law of 
armed conflict(LOAC). 

- Consequently, some so-called CNAs (especially, those used only 
asmeans of intelligence gathering) do not qualify as ‘attacks’ in the 
sense ofLOAC. Only CNAs entailing ‘violence’ do. CNAs constituting 
‘attacks’ in theLOAC sense are governed by the same rules that apply 
to kinetic attacks. Inparticular, they are subject to the application 
of the cardinal principle of distinc-tion  between  
combatants/military  objectives  and  civilians/civilian  
objects.Consequently, deliberate attacks against civilians/civilian 
objects are prohibited,and so are indiscriminate attacks.

- When a civilian isengaged in any form in a CNA, the act constitutes 
direct participation in hosti-lities and the actor loses civilian 
protection from attack.

# (sutherland2015geneva)

- Considerable scholarly effort has been invested in interpreting the 
existing internationallegal instruments and diplomatic conventions 
that applyto kinetic warfare in relationto the field of 
cyber-warfare. 

- The TallinnManualand other documents argue thatcurrent humanitarian 
laws are applicable in cyber-conflict. 

- Thereisgeneral consensusamongstWestern states thatthe core 
legalconstructsthatapplyto kineticwarfareshouldalso applyin the 
cyber-domain.

- Thereare numerous examplesof acceptedmilitarydoctrine thatcanbe 
appliedto the conceptsofcyber-warfare–such as the US Departmentof 
Defense’s FieldManualsandtheUK JointService Manualonthe 
LawofArmedConflict –and it is recognised thatexisting 
internationalagreements applyto acts in cyberspace.

- Analysis of current legislation concludesthatthoseentitiesprotected 
duringakinetic conflict shouldbe accorded the sameprotectionduring 
acyber-conflict,as outlined in theTallinn Manual:‘totheextent 
persons,objects,and activitiesbenefit from the protection of the lawof

- Currently,the realityis 
thatthemajorityoftransnationalcyber-attacksarecarriedout by non-state

Geneva Conventions.

# {rowe2010ethics}

- Many people assume these are relatively benign weapons, but we argue 
they can create seriousharms like any weapon.

- Cyberweapons  are  software  used  to  attack  other  software  or  
data  within  computer  systems  (Bayles,  2001). We distinguish 
cyberweapons and cyberattacks (attacks using cyberweapons) from 
“information warfare”, amore   general   term   that   includes   
propaganda,   electronic   surveillance,   cyber-espionage,   and   
defensiveinformation operations.

- Like  conventional  weapons,  cyberweapons  can  be  used  against  
a  variety  of  targets  in  a  variety  ofcircumstances with a wide 
range of lethality.

- Proponents  have  cited  these  as  "clean"  weapons  that  are  
safer  than  conventionalweapons  since  they  do  not  damage  
physical  objects.

-  Furthermore,  unlike  chemical,biological,  and  nuclear  weapons,  
people  have  no  visceral  fear  of  cyberweapons  for  reasons  like 
 healthconsequences. 

# {dipert2010ethics}

- ‘Cyberwarfare’ is a recent term: the Oxford English Dictionary gives 
its firstuse as 1994.

- In May 2010, the US Department of Defense formed a fullcommand, 
Cyber Command, headed by a simultaneously promoted four-stargeneral, 
General Keith Alexander, who also continues to serve as director of 
the  US  National  Security  Agency  (NSA).  He  had  earlier  noted  
that  theChinese government has hackerscybersoldiersorganized into 
battalionsand regiments.

- Cyberwarfare has several unusual features. It is arguably the first 
major newform  of  warfare  since  the  development  of  nuclear  
weapons  and  interconti-nental missiles. This novelty has also meant 
that there is at present a virtualpolicy vacuum: there are no 
informed, open, public or political discussions ofwhat an ethical and 
wise policy for the use of such weapons would be.

- Second, it is very difficult to determine the source of 
cyberattacks: this isthe  ‘attribution  problem.’  This  fact  would  
give  many  cyberattacks  credibledeniabilityespecially since in many 
cases nations can plausibly claim thatthe   attacks   may   have   
originated   from   within   their   territory   but   
theirgovernments did not initiate them.

- Third,  many  cyberattacks  will  not  be  lethal  and  will  not  
even  result  inpermanent damage to physical objects. This is of 
course extremely dissimilarfrom nuclear weapons and from virtually all 
traditional weapons of war.

- Fourth, there are no exotic components to cyberweapons, again very 
unlikenuclear and other advanced technology weapons, and even unlike 
chemical orbiological  weapons.  Any  computer  is  a  potential  
cyberweapon  and  anyonewith advanced knowledge of information systems 
is a potential cybercomba-tant   (Talbot   2010).   This   makes   
treaties   that   would   ban   cyberweaponsvirtually impossible from 
the outset (Libicki 2009).

- One  feature  that  cyberwarfare  unfortunately  shares  with  
warfare  usingnon-cyber  weapons  is  that  defense  is  expensive  
and  liable  to  failure,  whileoffense  is  comparably  cheap:  this  
parallels  the  well-known  difficulties  withnuclear civil  defense,  
with  anti-missile  technologies,  body armor,  protectionagainst  
improvised  explosive  devices  (IEDs),  and  so  on  (Talbot  
2010).Another  feature  that  cyberwarfare  shares  with  conventional 
 warfare  is  thelow degree of certainty of what will happen with an 
attack, or in a war, andthat  there  are  distant,  deleterious  side  
effects  that  cannot  adequately  beanticipateddisease, economic 
consequences, and so on.

- On  close  examination,  cyberwarfare  appears  to  be  almost  
entirely  unad-dressed by the traditional morality and laws of war.

-  Insome rare cases, the morally permissible response to a 
cyberattack may be aharsher  retaliatory  cyberattack,  or  even  a  
conventional  attack.  As  notedelsewhere  (Owens  et  al.  1999:  
41f)  the  requirement  of  proportionality  inresponse to aggression 
does not require counterattack-in-kind, especially if itwould not 
redress the harm done, diminish the threat, or deter future 
attack.This seems to open a window in which a morally permissible 
proper responseto a damaging cyberattack is sometimes conventional, 
physical action.

- Nevertheless, a cyberattack may do such extensive damage to the 
well-beingof a populace, and to the functioning of a government, that 
it would satisfythecasus  belli(just  cause)  requirement  of  
reasonable  criteria  for  morallygoing to war.

- There  is  widespread  agreement  (Libicki,  Owens  et  al.,  and  
myself)  thatsomething  like  Cyber-arms  Control  treaties  will  not 
 be  forthcoming  andperhaps  even  would  be  impossible  to  
enforce.

- Cyberarms  are  very  unlike  conven-tional, nuclear, biological, 
and chemical (NBC) arms.

- Part of the problem is epistemic (attribution), but part is also due 
to the factthat cyberattack toolsunlike NBC weaponsare already held 
by diverseindividuals and non-state actors.

- Libicki and I tend to believe that the use orthreat of cyberattacks 
as deterrence is morally permissible and even desirableas policy.

- First, thereis a large array of possible scenarios involving 
cyberattacks for which there donot  exist  obvious  moral  reasoning,  
or  even  straightforward  analogies,  thatcould guide us.

-  Second, I am disturbed by the extent to which, through easyInternet 
access, much of our economic and defense informatics infrastructureis 
vulnerable to attack.

- Third,it  is  clear  especially  from  General  Alexander’s  
comments  (notably  his  2007paper) that serious thought is being 
devoted to the development of policy andstrategy. To date it has 
remained largely shrouded in secrecy. This will be, andmaybe even now 
may be, a serious problem, since the making public of manyelements of 
policy are absolutely required for a deterrent effect.

- Finally,  it  is  interesting  that,  as  far  as  I  can  see,  
traditional  ethical  andpolitical theoriesutilitarianism, Kantian 
theory, natural rights theory, etc.cast so little light on this new, 
and difficult domain. Certainly no one of thesetheories seems at a 
special advantage in clarifying the issues

# {meulenbelt2012worm}

- In October 2010, the British government stated in the National 
Security Strategy that cyber-crime had become one of the ‘tier one 
threats’ to the UK, putting it on a par with (international) 
terrorism.

- The world's superpower, the US, even fears that cyber-attacks are 
possibly going to be its ‘next Pearl Harbour’.

- The discovery of the so-called ‘Stuxnet worm’ in June 2010, which 
‘is believed to be the first-known worm designed to target real-world 
[critical] infrastructure such as (nuclear) power stations, water 
plants and industrial units’, suggests that a threat indeed exists.

- Experts have claimed that Stuxnet's complexity suggests it could 
only have been written by a state. There are strong clues that Israel, 
in co-operation with the US, developed and tested this worm in order 
to bring the Iranian nuclear programme to a standstill.

- The emergence of ‘electronic and cyberwar-fighting capabilities’ has 
been described as ‘the most important military development in decades, 
but it is not yet clear how existing treaties and conventions might 
apply in this new domain of conflict’.

- Cyber-attacks are a relatively new phenomenon. The Russian 
cyber-attack on Estonia in 2007 is considered the first large-scale 
incident of a cyber-assault on a state.

- Because of cyber-attacks’ ‘newness’, international law is still 
struggling to provide a framework for it. For instance, there is no 
clear international legal definition of cyber-attacks. 

- Furthermore, there are currently no specific international 
provisions to regulate cyber-attacks. Yet, the international nature of 
this rapidly growing problem – consider that cyber-attacks often cross 
multiple administrative, jurisdictional and national boundaries – 
indicates that it does require an international response.

- In addition, the potential damage that can result from a 
cyber-attack, the fact the equipment required for perpetrating an 
attack is cheap and widely available, as well as the expertise 
required, and that it can be done from anywhere in the world also 
suggests that a common international legal approach to address the 
problem is needed. 

- Currently, there is no universal agreement on the precise meaning of 
a cyber-attack, its consequences and whether it constitutes force or 
not, nor how to respond to it. In other words, there is no certainty 
as to how the international community will or should apply the 
principles of international law to regulate cyber-attacks.

- Nevertheless, it is generally agreed upon that cyber-attacks are a 
breach of the customary international law principle of 
non-intervention, because they interfere in the internal and/or 
external affairs of a state.

-  In the absence of specific provisions to regulate cyber-attacks, 
these principles of non-intervention and due diligence can provide a 
framework for dealing with the issue.

# {dunlap2013some}

- In a recent op-ed, President Obama warns that “the cyber threat to 
our nation is one of the most se-rious economic and national security 
challenges we face.

# {fleck2013searching}

- TheTallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber 
Warfare1wasprepared at the invitation of the NATO Cooperative Cyber 
Defence Centre ofExcellence  (CCDCOE).  

- As  declared  by  the  Centre,  this  work  is  ‘intended  tolead 
to a restatement and manual on the international law applicable to 
cyber warfare, similar to the manuals on the law applicable to armed 
conflicts at sea(1994)  and  air  and  missile  warfare  (2010)’

- Although  theManualtext  itself  takes  a  more  cautious  approach  
by  statingthat ‘any claim that every assertion in the Manual 
represents an incontrovertiblerestatement of international law would 
be an exaggeration’ and that theManual‘does not set forthlex ferenda, 
best practice, or preferred policy’

- By applying ‘extant legal norms’ to cyberspace, theTallinn 
Manualconvincinglyshows  that  international  law  is  not  silent  on 
 new  technological  developments.

- Hence, any claim that cyber operations were subjectto  international 
 legal  regulation  only  on  the  basis  of  new  treaty  law  has  
beenconvincingly  proven  by  the  International  Group  of  Experts  
as  being  legallyunfounded.

- TheTallinn Manualdoes not offer a discussion of cyber operations 
below thethreshold of an (international or non-international) armed 
conflict.

# {barrett2015reliable}

- The FirstGulf War, with its precision guided munitions (PGMs), was a 
first step in redeemingmodern distance warfare. But cyber capabilities 
represent a leap. With them, statesostensibly can create tailored 
effects from a distance, and do soBnon-kinetically^—without mass 
moving through space. Cyber capabilities promise to marry the 
precision ofPGMs and reach of unmanned aerial vehicles to the light 
touch of so-called non-lethalweapons.

- Cyber-espionage enables state and non-state actors—often 
incollusion—to steal economic and governmental information, and thus 
undermine asociety’s prosperity and security.

- Second, the direct effects of cyber-attacks includedamage and 
destruction of computer hardware, software, and data.

- Third, because oflinks between computer networks the external world, 
indirect effects of cyber-attacksinclude damage and destruction to 
property, and injury and death to persons.

- Fourth,grave indirect effects can result from merely temporary 
losses of computer functionality.

- A fifth reason forconcern: attribution difficulties undermine 
punishment-based deterrence of all thesescenarios

- And finally, inadequate intelligence on targeted networks can 
render cyber-attacks indiscriminate and disproportionate.

- Contrary to the concerns of some ethicists, the traditionaljust war 
criteria—if properly understood—are capable of providing the guidance 
thatleaders need to legitimately respond to and conduct cyber 
operations.

- In the cyber domain, the number ofad bellumandin belloissues 
requiring analysis issmall, and the traditional just war criteria are 
capable of providing ethical guidance.

- However, military cyber operations highlight two theoretical issues 
within just wartradition that deserve further attention. First, while 
the criteria provide clear guidelinesconcerning lethal defensive 
responses to cyber-attacks, and concerning the use of cyberforce 
within wars, they lack specificity concerning justified responses to 
the constantlow-level harm most likely to be encountered in 
cyberspace. Second, what rules must govern the use of nonlethal 
forceagainst liableBindirect participants^such as financial 
supporters?

# {delerue2019reinterpretation}

- The development of cyber threats constitutes a significant challenge 
for international peace andstability.

- Professors Heike Krieger and Georg Nolte have correctly 
identifiedthat the development of cyberspace may create new challenges 
for international law.

- Thus, and second, the development of cyberspace and cyber operations 
challenges norms ofinternational law that already face a certain level 
of uncertainty and contestation in both their con-tent and their 
application.

- In this complex context, the successive UN GGEhave managed to 
reach agreement and produce reports. The 2013 and 2015 reports were 
particu-larly significant because they acknowledged the applicability 
of international law and the UNCharter to cyberspace.

- In June 2017, however, thefifth UN GGE failed to reach a consensuson 
itsfinal report. Some states dispute the applicability to cyberspace 
of entire branches of inter-national law, such as the law of armed 
conflict, self-defence and counter-measures. This situationposes a 
particular challenge to international law and there is a risk of 
geographical fragmentationof international law norms applicable to 
cyberspace.

- The applicability of international law to cyberspace and cyber 
operations has been settled in bothstate practice and the academic 
literature. Consequently, the question has now become‘what isthe 
specific interpretation and application of the norms of international 
law in this challengingcontext?'

- This question has been tackled by various initiatives, such as the 
UN GGE and alsothe Tallinn Manual process sponsored by the NATO 
Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre ofExcellence (CCDCOE), which led to 
the adoption of the two editions of the Tallinn Manual pub-lished in 
2013 and 2017.

# {assidiq2020qualifying}

- Today’s  technological  developments  have  resulted  in  the  
emergence  of  various  new  crimes  threatening  the  international  
community.  In  recent  decades,  there  have been various forms of 
cybercrimes targeted at the communication networks and  defense  
systems  of  countries  by  other  countries,  known  as  cyber  
warfare.  Unfortunately, international law has not specified this as a 
crime, but its impact has caused violations of sovereignty and 
disruption of national security, resulting in material loss, breakdown 
of communication networks and obstruction of social and  public  
services  based  on  the  internet,  such  as  what  happened  in  
Estonia  in  2007.

- Cyber  warfare  is  the  use  of  cyber  technology  to  attack  
various  public  facilities  that  are related to the national 
security and sovereignty of a country by another country, either  
directly  or  through  an  established  proxy.

- The  last  35  years  has  shown  the  involvement of countries in 
cyberattacks against other countries, such as Operation Orchard  
involving  Israel  and  Syria,  the  cyberattack  on  Estonia  in  
2007  allegedly  carried  out  by  Russia,  and  Operation  Olympic  
Games  (Stuxnet  case)  involving  the  US  and  Iran  in  2010.  In  
CASCON  records,  there  have  been  85  cases  of  “kinetic”warfare,3 
which means the “utilization of technology as a tool to attack one 
state.”

- Until  today,  no  international  convention  or  agreement  on  
cybercrime  has  been  adopted.5At this time, there is only a draft 
manual from NATO that is used as guidelines for cyberattacks  regarded 
 as  crimes  of  aggression,  cyber  operations  against  important  
infrastructure  of  a  country,  and  cyberattacks  targeting  enemy  
commands  and  control  systems.

- Technology  is  developing  rapidly,  and  if  it  is  not  properly 
 controlled,  a  new  form  of  armed  attacks  would  threaten  the  
peace  and  stability  of  the  international  community.  A  
cyberattack  is  a  new  international  crime.  

- Since  the  late  1980s,  cyberattacks have evolved to use ICT 
innovations to commit cybercrimes. 

- In recent years,  notable  developments,  such  as  the  cyberattack 
 in  Estonia  in  2007  allegedly  carried out by Russia and the 
Operation Olympic Games (Stuxnet) involving the US and  Iran  in  
2010,  have  sparked  the  need  to  seriously  consider  monitoring  
internet-based  crimes  across  the  world.  These  crimes  have  also 
 caused  material  loss  to  the  affected countries.

-  Cyberattack is considered as a form of war maneuver in order to 
defeat  the  opponent  and  destroying  their  ability  to  
counterattack.  

- The  absence  of  international  norms  to  regulate  cybercrime  in 
 the  form  of  cyber  war  could  trigger  kinetic  warfare. 

# {thumfart2020public}

- There is a growing tendency to apply just war theory to cyberspace.

- First: just war theory drafts a way in which individual states can 
secure international peace.

- since they are not directly connected to military losses, relatively 
cheap to execute anddifficult to attribute, cyber warfare and cyber 
attacks encourage offensive strategies.

- Although it is a broad consensus that international law and the UN 
Charter in general apply tocyberspace, there is still no specific 
international legal framework concerning cyber attacks

- This lack of legal framework or even basic orientation primarily 
concerns jus ad bellum, i.e.thequestion of when a state has the right 
to retaliate cyber attacks proportionately.

- The Tallinn Manual 2.0, which is issued by NATO to clarify the 
application of international lawto cyber attacks, is explicitly 
undecided on the matter. On the one hand, it generally states that“the 
right to employ force in self-defence extends beyond kinetic armed 
attacks to those that areperpetrated solely through cyber operations.” 
And it expresses a broad consensus by stating thata “cyber operation 
that seriously injures or kills a number of persons or that causes 
significantdamage to, or destruction of, property would satisfy the 
scale and effects requirement” 

- On the other hand, the manual expresses significant uncertainty 
concerning cyber aggressionswithout direct physical consequences, such 
as the manipulation of elections, stock markets ordeliberative 
processes in the public sphere. “The case of cyber operations that do 
not result ininjury,  death,  damage,  or  destruction,  but  that  
otherwise  have  extensive  negative  effects,remains unsettled"

- Likewise, in 2018, the US State Department called for a “fundamental 
rethinking” of “strategiesfor deterring malicious cyber activities” 

- This is all the more urgent because in cyberspace “the top 
techcompanies appear to be as powerful as States, and sometimes even 
more so, to prevent cyberattacks, attribute them and to respond to 
malicious acts”. And Facebook and Google have already engaged in 
active cyber defense without having been prosecuted by the US 
government.

- Nevertheless,  the  Tallinn  Manual  unambiguously  reads:  “Only  
States  may  takecountermeasures. For example, an information 
technology firm may not act on its own initiativein responding to a 
harmful cyber operation” 

-  A clear expression of this virtually globalconsensus is that cyber 
attacks with physically violent effects are extremely rare, also 
beyondNATO states. Due to their unclear legal status much more 
attractive and frequent are cyberaggressions  aimed  at  manipulating  
deliberative  processes  in  the  public  sphere.  They  aretherefore 
a much more urgent object of a theory of just cyberwar.

- Due to these questions, in section 1, I will go back to the origin 
of modern just war theory andinternational law, to Francisco de 
Vitoria, who developed a framework of international law 
thatunderstands  communication  as  the  highest  normative  value.  
Contrary  to  contemporarymisconceptions of just war theory (Taddeo, 
2014, p. 7), Vitoria’s original doctrine did not focuson the 
physicality of the means or the effects of an attack as casus belli, 
but rather on the gravityof the violation of rights connected to an 
attack, especially in regard to communication, whichmakes his theory 
interesting to contemporary problems.

- In this context, I will also discuss Vitoria’s early answer to the 
attribution problem in section 2:the conduct of coercion-free and 
transparent multi-stakeholder discourses that minimise therisk  of  
false  attribution,  which  resembles  the  contemporary  demand  to  
constitute  anindependent global institution responsible for 
attributing cyber attacks 

- This  contribution  aimed  at  counteracting  two  shortcomings  of  
just  cyberwar  theory:  theinsufficient discussion of non-violent 
cyberattacks that are directed at the public sphere and theomission of 
the role of non-state actors.

- In section 1, I discussed the problem of the lack of immediate 
physical violence of cyber attackson the public sphere. This makes it 
difficult to characterise them as a prohibited use of forceunder the 
UN Charter.

- Also, I discussed newer frameworks, such as the Tallinn Manual’s 
effect-based and coercion-centred approach to the assessment of cyber 
attacks

# {barrett2017relationship}

- This essay will examine this question byfirst critiquing a legal 
anal-ysis of a new form of conflict: military cyber operations. These 
operations possessan unusual combination of characteristics as they 
() do not involve munitionsmoving  through  space  and  across  
borders,  ()  often  originate  from  or  traverseinnocent 
third-party states, () can be difficult to attribute, () are often 
purveyedby nonstate actors, and () frequently produce effects that do 
not neatly coincidewith legal definitions such as“uses of force.”

- As a consequence of these unusualcharacteristics,  experts  have  
labored  to  apply  to  cyber  operations  existing  legalframeworks  
that  govern  international  violence.  The  most  influential  effort 
 todate has been theTallinn Manual on the International Law 
Applicable toCyber  Warfare;

- While states have always used sublethal harms to weaken adversaries 
eco-nomically, militarily, ideologically, culturally, and politically, 
technological devel-opments  have  magnified  the  regularity  and  
effectiveness  of  these  practices,particularly  against  free  
societies.

# {schmitt2015notion}

- The cyber operations mounted during the Russia–Ukraine and 
Palestine–Israel conflicts of 2014have demonstrated the continued 
necessity for clarification as to how international law is to 
beinterpreted and applied with respect to activities in 
cyberspace.1Unfortunately, the few state-ments that states have issued 
on the matter lack the granularity required to be 
operationallymeaningful.

- State reticence to stake out positions with regard to cyber 
operations has become chronic. Thecyber operations conducted against 
Estonia in 2007 and mounted during the international armedconflict 
between Georgia and Russia the following year revealed a distinct lack 
of forethought onthe part of the international law community in 
general, and states in particular, as to howinternational 
law–especially thejus ad bellum(law governing the resort to force by 
states) andjus in bello(international humanitarian law or IHL)–governs 
activities in cyberspace.

- Inresponse to this lacuna, the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre 
of Excellence, which isbased in Tallinn (Estonia), commissioned a 
three-year research project to examine the law ofcyber conflict. The 
project drew together an‘International Group of Experts’(IGE) which 
con-sisted of 16 renowned international law academics and 
practitioners working in their personalcapacity (numerous experts were 
then serving as senior legal advisers for their governments).A team of 
technical advisers assisted them and observers from NATO, the United 
StatesCyber Command and the International Committee of the Red Cross 
(ICRC) participated activelyduring the deliberations. The work of the 
IGE was subsequently peer reviewed by 13 inter-national law 
specialists andfine-tuned based on their recommendations. In 2013, 
CambridgeUniversity Press published thefinal product as theTallinn 
Manual on the International LawApplicable to Cyber Warfare.

- The Tallinn Manual consists of 95‘rules’adopted unanimously by the 
IGE. Each ruleexpressed the IGE’s opinion regarding the state of 
customary international law (including thatreflected in key treaties 
such as the UN Charter) as of July 2012, the date of the meeting 
atwhich it adopted thefinal draft. The requirement for unanimity meant 
that the rules reflectedthe lowest common normative denominator.

- Accompanying each of the rules is commentary that identifies its 
legal basis, explains its nor-mative content, addresses practical 
implications thereof in the cyber context, and sets forth dif-fering 
views on the scope or interpretation of the rule

- Thesine qua nonof the Tallinn Manual process was agreement on the 
applicability of thejusad bellumandjus in belloto cyber operations. 
Consensus was quickly achieved on this point, one that appears to be 
widely accepted today.

- With regard to IHL, the experts accordingly concurredthat the extant 
law governed cyber weapons and cyber operations;6the issue was 
notwhetherIHLapplied, buthow.

- The reaction of the international legal community to the Tallinn 
Manual, especially state legaladvisers, has been favourable. Today it 
is widely used in ministries of defence and foreign affairs.With 
respect to its IHL provisions, only two issues have generated 
noteworthy debate–themeaning of the term‘attack’, a topic addressed in 
passing below, and the IHL notion of‘objects’,the focus of this 
article. Both have been the subject of debate behind closed doors 
during gov-ernmental discussions and in open discourse throughout 
academia. The question with respect tothe latter is 
whether‘data’constitutes an object such that the IHL protection 
afforded to civilianobjects extends to it.

- This process will be evolutionary, not revolutionary. States are 
unlikely to countenance treatingall (or even just operational-level) 
data as an object subject to the relevant IHL prohibitions.

- Given the reality of a densely interconnected     informa-tion 
society, much has been written  about  the  possibility  that 
adversaries of the US—such as ter-rorists  or  hostile  nations—might 
conduct   damaging   cyberattacks against critical sectors of our 
econ-omy  and  national  infrastructure, which  depend  on  reliably  
func-tioning,  secure  computer  systems and networks.

- For some years, the topic  of  cybersecurity  has  been an important 
part of the National Research  Council’s  (NRC’s)  re-port  portfolio, 
 and  a  great  deal  of national  attention  has  focused  on the 
problem of how to protect the US  against  such  attacks—that  is, how 
 to  defend  these  systems  and networks   in   both   military   and 
non-military    contexts.   

-  This reality  hasn’t  been  lost  on  the  US government, which 
acknowledges that  it  has  interests  in  cyberattack capabilities as 
a possible instrument of  national  policy.

- The  pri-mary message of that study is that US acquisition and use 
of cyberat-tack raise several important policy issues  that  many  
policy  makers don’t  understand  well.

- A  greater degree  of  transparency  on  this topic will help the 
nation have an informed debate about the poten-tially  very  important 
 role  of  cy-berattack  as  an  instrument  of  US policy, and will 
provide the over-sight  necessary  to  exercise  these capabilities  
in  an  appropriate  and responsible fashion that serves the overall 
national interest.  

- Cyberattack  technologies  bring to  the  forefront  of  policy  a 
wide range of possibilities in many dimensions: they raise several new 
policy  issues,  provide  many  more options for operational 
command-ers,  and  complicate  existing  legal regimes  to  a  
considerable  extent. 

# {goldsmith2013cyber}

- Michael Walzer’s Just and Unjust Wars anticipated many problems and 
developments in the laws of  war. But it understandably did not 
anticipate how the Internet and asso-ciated computer and 
telecommunications revolutions would change war or the laws that 
govern it.

-  In 1977, the year Walzer’s book was published, Arpanet, the 
Internet’s precursor, had been operating in practical secrecy with a 
crude packet-switching sys-tem for just eight years; the first email 
system was five years old; and Vinton Cerf  and Bob Kahn had used the 
term ‘Internet’ for the first time in a paper on the Transmission 
Control Protocol just three years earlier. 

- No one at this time, or for more than a decade, would worry much 
about the internal security vulnerabilities of  this developing 
com-munications  system.  The  wake-up  call  for  security,  such  as 
 it  was,  came  in  1988,  when  Robert  Tappan  Morris,  a  graduate 
 student  at  Cornell,  introduced  a  worm  on  the Internet that was 
designed to determine the Internet’s size but that inadvertently shut  
down  about  10  per  cent  of   the  60,000  computers  then  
connected  to  it.1  This  event startled the Defense Advanced 
Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the futuristic Department of  
Defense (DOD) research wing. DARPA had given its financial support to 
what became the Internet to ensure that military communications could 
withstand nuclear attack. But suddenly its young creation seemed 
vulnerable from within.

- These vulnerabilities would grow in the next two decades because, 
despite growing cyber-security  concerns,  the  military  and  the  
society  it  defends  would  become  ever  more reliant on ever more 
vulnerable computer and telecommunication systems. 

- Even if  we assume that some of  the puzzles in Section 2 can be 
worked out, and that nations of  the world can agree in theory on how 
jus ad bellum and jus in bello should apply to the cyber realm, a 
further hurdle stands in the way of  developing true inter-national 
norms to reflect this substantive agreement.9 The main hurdle is 
verification, which is difficult in the cyber realm because 
attribution is challenging.

- If  one sees the laws of  war in instrumental terms, akin to 
solutions to a prisoners’ dilemma, then it is doubtful that a rational 
government would forego using otherwise desired cyber-exploitation or 
cyber-attack capabilities in compliance with an interna-tional norm in 
exchange for mutual restraint by adversaries. The main reason is that 
a government cannot tell whether its adversary is complying with the 
norm, and thus it  cannot  know  (until  it  is  too  late)  whether  
it  is  receiving  a  benefit  for  its  restraint.  Moreover, 
cooperation in the prisoners’ dilemma depends on credible retaliation 
when there is breach. Uncertainty in attribution makes retaliation for 
breach much harder for any president or general to order. (‘Sir, we 
are 28 per cent sure the Chinese did it.’) And this in turn makes 
retaliation less credible to some probably large degree, which in turn 
invites breach and unravels cooperation.

- And in fact there have been many reports that the DOD is deeply 
self-constrained – some say too constrained – by the laws of  war in 
its use of  offensive cyber weapons.

- There are many reasons for scepticism, but the main one is the 
problem of  attribution. The laws of  war would not be nearly as 
efficacious or have the same level of  normative salience, if  the 
nations that violated the laws could not  be  identified  and  
publicly  shamed.  Norms  cannot  get  much  purchase  in  a  world 
without serious attribution; anonymity is a norm destroyer. That, 
unfortu-nately, is the situation in the cyber realm. The problem is 
exacerbated by the fact that, even if  a nation has perfect 
attribution, it often cannot publicly reveal the evidence  of   
attribution  because  doing  so  would  disclose  espionage  and  
attribu-tion capabilities and render them less useful. To the extent 
that this is so, it makes the  public  shaming  aspects  of   a  
verification  regime,  and  thus  the  operation  of   norms, less 
robust.

-  The moderately good news, I think, is that, although many nations 
have the capabilities to engage in large-scale cyber war, they are not 
using the weapons because doing so would be self-defeating. Even with 
the cloak of  relative anonymity, the poten-tial  catastrophic  costs  
to  the  globally  integrated  computer  and  telecommunications  
infrastructure from a large-scale cyber war creates powerful 
disincentives for a nation to engage in such war. One can, if  one 
likes, call mutual restraint of  this sort a ‘norm’. This  norm  is  
nothing  more  than  a  behavioural  regularity  resulting  from  the  
coinci-dence of  uncoordinated self-interest among nations. But if  
every nation continues to have such independent incentives, cyber war 
might not emerge.

- It  is  true  that  China has significant offensive cyber 
capacities that could in theory cause enormous destruction, and that 
it is stockpiling cyber weapons and planning for cyber war. But the  
same  is  true  of   the  United  States.

- Capacities  and  contin-gency plans, taken alone, do not add up to a 
serious threat. There must also be a plau-sible scenario in which a 
nation has the motivation to use these weapons.

- It is also possible that the stealth cyber-arms  race,  the  
difficulty  of   knowing  for  sure  which  nation  is  behind  a  
cyber  attack,  and the general absence of  effective norms to govern 
such attacks combine to create an unstable situation in which 
destructive cyber activities might escalate by accident.

- Cyber warfarefigures prominently on the agenda of policymakers and 
militaryleaders around the world. New units to ensure cyber security 
are created at variouslevels of government, including in the armed 
forces.

- But cyber operations in armedconflict situations could have 
potentially very serious consequences, in particularwhen their effect 
is not limited to the data of the targeted computer system orcomputer. 
Indeed, cyber operations are usually intended to have an effect in 
the‘realworld’. 

- It is therefore important to discuss the rules of 
internationalhumanitarian law (IHL) that govern such operations 
because one of the mainobjectives of this body of law is to protect 
the civilian population from the effects ofwarfare.

- In particular, the interconnectednessof cyber space poses a 
challenge to the most fundamental premise of the rules on theconduct 
of hostilities, namely that civilian and military objects can and 
must bedistinguished at all times. Thus, whether the traditional rules 
of IHL will providesufficient protection to civilians from the effects 
of cyber warfare remains to be seen.Their interpretation will 
certainly need to take the specificities of cyber space intoaccount. 
In the absence of better knowledge of the potential effects of cyber 
warfare, itcannot be excluded that more stringent rules might be 
necessary.

- Cyber securityfigures prominently on the agenda of policymakers and 
militaryleaders around the world. A recently published study by the 
United NationsInstitute for Disarmament Research (UNIDIR) describes 
the measures taken bythirty-three states that have specifically 
included cyber warfare in their militaryplanning and organisation, and 
gives an overview of the cyber security approach ofthirty-six other 
states.1These range from states with very advanced statementsof 
doctrine and military organisations employing hundreds or thousands 
ofindividuals to more basic arrangements that incorporate cyber attack 
and cyberwarfare into existing capabilities for electronic warfare. A 
number of states aresetting up specialized units in or outside of 
their armed forces to deal with cyberoperations.2It has also been 
reported that twelve of the world’sfifteen largestmilitary forces are 
building cyber warfare programmes.

- As noted in the introduction, cyber operations will entail new means 
and methodsof combat, the effects of which are still untested or 
poorly understood. 

- It appears,however, that military use of information technology 
poses serious challenges to theapplication of IHL, in particular with 
respect to the very premise that civilian andmilitary objects can and 
must be distinguished in armed conflict.

- In order to obtainclear statements about how states intend to 
respect the principles of distinction,proportionality, and precaution, 
this should be discussed more openly and candidlythan has been the 
case until now.

- In light of the dangers that cyber warfare poses to civilian 
infrastructurea number of solutions are being proposedde lege 
lataandde lege ferenda.Oneproposal is for states to make declaratory 
statements about digital safe havens,that is, civilian targets that 
they will consider off-limits in the conduct of cyber operations. If 
agreed among the parties, this would be akin to the demilitarizedzones 
foreseen in Article 60 of Additional Protocol I. 

- Given the concealed nature of much of what appears to be the 
currentmanipulation and infiltration of cyber space, it is not clear 
how much trust will be putin agreements or statements on cyber areas 
that would be off-limits for military use.

- Another proposal made by Geiss and Lahmann is to expand the list 
of‘works and installations containing dangerous forces’in Article 56 
of AdditionalProtocol I by analogy. This could apply to specific cyber 
infrastructurecomponents, such as major Internet exchange nodes or 
central servers on whichmillions of important civilian functions 
rely. 

- Going further, the challenges posed by the cyber realm have also 
raised thequestion whether (some) means and methods of cyber warfare 
should be bannedaltogether or regulated by international treaty. As 
mentioned in the introduction,some states have advocated for a new 
treaty in this respect, although the contours ofwhat should and should 
not be allowed are not always entirely clear. A paralleldebate is also 
being held among cyber security experts and academics. Somehave 
proposed new treaties on cyber warfare,155while others argue that 
there shouldbe a type of disarmament treaty with a ban on all or at 
least some cyber weapons.

- Still others counter that a treaty would not be enforceable because 
of the difficultiesof attribution, that it would be technically 
impossible to distinguish betweeninstruments of cyber warfare and 
cyber espionage, that the banned weaponscould be less damaging than 
traditional weapons, and that verification would beimpossible.

- Some commentators propose other solutions, such as‘informal 
multi-lateralism’,158or an international cyber security organisation, 
along the lines of theInternational Atomic Energy Agency, as an 
independent platform for internationalcooperation, with the aim of 
developing treaties to control cyber weapons

- In the meantime, ifparties to conflicts choose cyber weapons during 
armed conflicts they must be awareof the existing legal framework as a 
minimum set of rules to respect, despite theirlimitations. They must 
instruct and train their forces accordingly.

-  It is important topromote the discussion of these issues, to raise 
awareness of the need to assess thehumanitarian impact of developing 
technologies, and to ensure that they are notprematurely employed 
under conditions in which respect for the law cannot beguaranteed.

- In conclusion, there is no question that IHL applies to cyber 
warfare.However, whether it will provide sufficient protection to the 
civilian population, inparticular by shielding civilian infrastructure 
from harm, will depend on howIHL–whose drafters did not envisage such 
operations–is interpreted with respectto them. Only if interpreted in 
good faith and with the utmost care will it be possibleto protect 
civilian infrastructure from being directly targeted or from 
sufferingdamage that could potentially be disastrous for the civilian 
population. Even then,considering the potential weaknesses of the 
principles of distinction, proportion-ality, and precaution–and in the 
absence of more profound knowledge of offensivecapabilities and 
effects–it cannot be excluded that more stringent rules might 
benecessary.

- The Tallinn Manual of 2013 and its second edition, the Tallinn 
Manual 2.0 of 2017, are NATO-funded analyses of how existing 
international laws of war apply to cybersecurity and cyberwarfare. 

- A characteristic of the Tallinn manuals that makes them worth 
studying now and ensures they will have very long shelf lives as desk 
references is that they include not only “black letter” points of law 
and other matters on which they all agreed [2]. They also discuss 
points upon which they could not agree, identifying majority and 
minority positions and in most cases including arguments offered by 
those who take each position.

- a second, somewhat smaller group of experts — partially overlapping 
with the group of those involved in the 2013 volume and partially not 
— was convened to work on a second edition by the NATO Cooperative 
Cyber Defense Center of Excellence (NATO CCD COE, https://ccdcoe.org/) 
in Tallinn, Estonia, that provided the institutional home for these 
processes.

-  As Kuhn tells us, the very level of complexity of the reasoning in 
the Tallinn manuals is a sign that the phenomena, events, and 
processes they talk about are not fully, or accurately, understood.
