    abstract = {The subreddit r/RoastMe presents an intriguing case of 
how alternative norms can emerge in subversive online communities, 
allowing behaviours conventionally condemned as inappropriate to be 
reframed as acceptable. In this community, users post photos of 
themselves with the explicit expectation of being mocked or ridiculed 
by others. This mixed-methods, within-subjects experiment explores the 
influence of three factors that allow negative comments to be framed 
as acceptable and appropriate within RoastMe: humour, a mean (but 
funny) normative tone, and explicit articulation of these norms. 117 
participants read, rated and reported their intended responses to 
humorous and non-humorous comments presented as being from RoastMe 
(explicitly mean but funny), ToastMe (explicitly positive), and two 
fictionalised communities where the normative tone was not explicitly 
defined (the mean but funny RateMe, and the positive DescribeMe). 
Results indicated clear interaction effects between community tone and 
norm explicitness, whereby comments from RoastMe were consistently 
rated and responded to most positively, and separate effects of humour 
on comment ratings and responses. Individual-level moral disengagement 
appeared central in allowing participants to excuse negative comments 
in humorous or permissive contexts. Consistent with benign violation 
theory, the explicitly negative tone of RoastMe was seen to create a 
shared understanding that users posting photos would expect and not be 
harmed by comments, allowing participants to reframe interactions as 
safe, acceptable and funny.},

    abstract = {The origins of digital money and blockchain technology 
goes back to the 1980s, but in the last decade, the blockchain 
technology gained large popularity in the financial sector with the 
appearance of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. However, recently, 
many other fields of application have been recognized, particularly 
with the development of smart contracts. Among them is the possible 
application of blockchain technology in the domain of land 
administration, mostly as a tool for transparency in the developing 
countries and means to fight corruption. However, developed countries 
also find interest in launching pilot projects to test their 
applicability in land administration domain for reasons such as to 
increase the speed and reduce costs of the real property transactions 
through a more secure environment. In this paper, we analyse how 
transactions are handled in Serbian land administration and how this 
process may be supported by modern ledger technologies such as 
blockchain. In order to analyse how blockchain could be implemented to 
support transactions in land information systems (LIS), it is 
necessary to understand cadastral processes and transactions in LIS, 
as well as legislative and organizational aspects of LIS. Transactions 
in cadastre comprise many actors and utilize both alphanumeric 
(descriptive or legal) data and geospatial data about property 
boundaries on the cadastral map. Based on the determined requirements 
for the blockchain-based LIS, we propose a system architecture for its 
implementation. Such a system keeps track of transactions in LIS in an 
immutable and tamper-proof manner to increase the security of the 
system and consequently increase the speed of transactions, 
efficiency, and data integrity without a significant impact on the 
existing laws and regulations. The system is anticipated as a 
permissioned public blockchain implemented on top of the Ethereum 
network.},

studied. Significant research has been conducted to address the myriad 
security concerns in these areas, but they are virtually all based on 
artificial testbeds or simulations designed on assumptions about their 
behavior either from knowledge of traditional IT networking or from 
basic principles of ICS operation. In this work, we provide the most 
detailed characterization of an example ICS to date in order to 
determine if these common assumptions hold true. A live power 
distribution substation is observed over the course of two and a half 
years to measure its behavior and evolution over time. Then, a 
horizontal study is conducted that compared this behavior with three 
other substations from the same company. Although most predictions 
were found to be correct, some unexpected behavior was observed that 
highlights the fundamental differences between ICS and IT networks 
including round trip times dominated by processing speed as opposed to 
network delay, several well known TCP features being largely 
irrelevant, and surprisingly large jitter from devices running 
real-time operating systems. The impact of these observations is 
discussed in terms of generality to other embedded networks, network 
security applications, and the suitability of the TCP protocol for

our society, so the inclusion of practical activities for education 
has become essential and useful at the same time. These activities are 
more noticeable in Engineering, in areas such as cybersecurity, data 
science, artificial intelligence, etc. Additionally, these activities 
acquire even more relevance with a distance education methodology, as 
our case is. The inclusion of these practical activities has clear 
advantages, such as (1) promoting critical thinking and (2) improving 
students{\rq} abilities and skills for their professional careers. 
There are several options, such as the use of remote and virtual 
laboratories, virtual reality and game-based platforms, among others. 
This work addresses the development of a new cloud game-based 
educational platform, which defines a modular and flexible 
architecture (using light containers). This architecture provides 
interactive and monitoring services and data storage in a transparent 
way. The platform uses gamification to integrate the game as part of 
the instructional process. The CyberScratch project is a particular 
implementation of this architecture focused on cybersecurity 
game-based activities. The data privacy management is a critical issue 
for these kinds of platforms, so the architecture is designed with 
this feature integrated in the platform components. To achieve this 
goal, we first focus on all the privacy aspects for the data generated 
by our cloud game-based platform, by considering the European legal 
context for data privacy following GDPR and ISO/IEC TR 20748-1:2016 
recommendations for Learning Analytics (LA). Our second objective is 
to provide implementation guidelines for efficient data privacy 
management for our cloud game-based educative platform. All these 
contributions are not found in current related works. The CyberScratch 
project, which was approved by UNED for the year 2020, considers using 
the xAPI standard for data handling and services for the game editor, 
game engine and game monitor modules of CyberScratch. Therefore, apart 
from considering GDPR privacy and LA recommendations, our cloud 
game-based architecture covers all phases from game creation to the 
final users{\rq} interactions with the game.},

the sooner preventive measures can be taken to ensure the resilience

technological advances, brought by the Industry 4.0 and cyber-physical

autonomous business logic (expressed in terms of simple business 
rules) and some central control mechanisms. We exemplify the 
instantiation and use of this architecture by means of a 
proof-of-concept implementation, using a multimodal logistics case 
study. The obtained results provide a basis for achieving supply chain

scalability) and also to reduce operational costs of companies as

should detect attacks by a continuous monitoring and mitigate the 
effects of these attacks by reliable reaction mechanisms. For this 
aim, an attack tolerance framework is proposed in this paper. This 
framework includes the risks analysis of attacks and is based on 
diversification and software reflection techniques. We applied this 
framework to cloud applications that are based on web services. After 
describing the core foundation of this approach, we express such cloud

(i.e., sensor) devices with cyber (i.e., informational) components to 
form a context-sensitive system that responds intelligently to dynamic 
changes in real-world situations. The CPS has wide applications in 
scenarios such as environment monitoring, battlefield surveillance, 
and traffic control. One key research problem of CPS is called mining 
lines in the sand. With a large number of sensors (sand) deployed in a 
designated area, the CPS is required to discover all trajectories 
(lines) of passing intruders in real time. There are two crucial 
challenges that need to be addressed: (1) the collected sensor data 
are not trustworthy, and (2) the intruders do not send out any 
identification information. The system needs to distinguish multiple 
intruders and track their movements. This study proposes a method 
called LiSM (Line-in-the-Sand Miner) to discover trajectories from 
untrustworthy sensor data. LiSM constructs a watching network from 
sensor data and computes the locations of intruder appearances based 
on the link information of the network. The system retrieves a cone 
model from the historical trajectories to track multiple intruders. 
Finally, the system validates the mining results and updates 
sensors{\rq} reliability scores in a feedback process. In addition, 
LoRM (Line-on-the-Road Miner) is proposed for trajectory discovery on 
road networks---mining lines on the roads. LoRM employs a 
filtering-and-refinement framework to reduce the distance 
computational overhead on road networks and uses a 
shortest-path-measure to track intruders. The proposed methods are 
evaluated with extensive experiments on big datasets. The experimental 
results show that the proposed methods achieve higher accuracy and 
efficiency in trajectory mining tasks.},

mapping complex applications on these platforms, aiming at optimizing 
their execution time. To provide optimal solutions for this problem in 
a short time, a new hybrid model that combines Integer Linear 
Programming (ILP) and Constraint Programming (CP) models is 
introduced. Also, to reduce the complexity of the model and its 
solution time, a set of novel techniques for generating additional 
constraints called Benders cuts is proposed. An extensive set of 
experiments has been performed in which synthetic applications 
described by Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) were mapped to a number of 
heterogeneous multicore platforms. Moreover, experiments with DAGs 
that correspond to two real-life applications have also been 
performed. Based on the experimental results, it is proven that the 
proposed approach outperforms the pure ILP model in terms of the 
solution time and quality of the solution. Specifically, the proposed 
approach is able to find an optimal solution within a time limit of 2 
hours in the vast majority of performed experiments, while the pure 
ILP model fails. Also, for the cases where both methods fail to find 
an optimal solution within the time limit, the solution of the

against security incidents, as future computing environments will 
continuously face security threats. This study first examines the 
literature on industrial security and its current status in South 
Korea, which is considered an active industrial security research 
environment. Subsequently, meta-analyses are conducted on South Korea 
and abroad to compare their status and research trends in the 
industrial security field. The results confirm that South Korea has 
more actively conducted relevant studies compared to international 
research. This study contributes to the current literature by not only 
increasing the awareness of industrial security but also encouraging 
future studies in the field to facilitate a safe and sustainable 
computing environment.},

    abstract = {Public key cryptographic primitive (e.g., the famous 
Diffie-Hellman key agreement, or public key encryption) has recently 
been used as a standard building block in authenticated key agreement 
(AKA) constructions for wireless sensor networks (WSNs) to provide 
perfect forward secrecy (PFS), where the expensive cryptographic 
operation (i.e., exponentiation calculation) is involved. However, 
realizing such complex computation on resource-constrained wireless 
sensors is inefficient and even impossible on some devices. In this 
work, we introduce a new AKA scheme with PFS for WSNs without using 
any public key cryptographic primitive. To achieve PFS, we rely on a 
new dynamic one-time authentication credential that is regularly 
updated in each session. In particular, each value of the 
authentication credential is wisely associated with at most one 
session key that enables us to fulfill the security goal of PFS. 
Furthermore, the proposed scheme enables the principals to identify 
whether they have been impersonated previously. We highlight that our 
scheme can be very efficiently implemented on sensors since only hash 
function and XOR operation are required.},

    abstract = {With the increasing popularity of online shopping 
markets, a significant number of consumers rely on these venues to 
meet their demands while choosing different products based on the 
ratings provided by others. Simultaneously, consumers feel confident 
in expressing their opinions through ratings. As a result, millions of 
ratings are generated on the web for different products, services, and 
dealers. Nonetheless, a noticeable number of users post unfair 
feedback. Recent studies have shown that reputation escalation is 
emerging as a new service, by which dealers pay to receive good 
feedback and escalate their ratings in online shopping markets. 
Therefore, finding robust and reliable ways to distinguish between 
fake and trustworthy ratings from users is a crucial task for every 
online shopping market. Moreover, with the dramatic increase in the 
number of ratings provided by consumers, scalability has arisen as 
another significant issue in the existing methods of reputation 
systems. To tackle these issues, we propose a randomized algorithm 
that calculates the reputation based on a random sample of the 
ratings. Since the randomly selected sample has a logarithmic size, it 
guarantees feasible scalability for large-scale online review systems. 
In addition, the randomness nature of the algorithm makes it robust 
against unfair ratings. We provide a thorough theoretical analysis of 
the proposed algorithm and validate its effectiveness through 
extensive empirical evaluation using real-world and synthetically 
generated datasets. Our experimental results show that the proposed 
method provides a high accuracy while running much faster than the 
existing iterative filtering approaches.},

    abstract = {Outlier detection is a statistical procedure that aims 
to find suspicious events or items that are different from the normal 
form of a dataset. It has drawn considerable interest in the field of 
data mining and machine learning. Outlier detection is important in 
many applications, including fraud detection in credit card 
transactions and network intrusion detection. There are two general 
types of outlier detection: global and local. Global outliers fall 
outside the normal range for an entire dataset, whereas local outliers 
may fall within the normal range for the entire dataset, but outside 
the normal range for the surrounding data points. This paper addresses 
local outlier detection. The best-known technique for local outlier 
detection is the Local Outlier Factor (LOF), a density-based 
technique. There are many LOF algorithms for a static data 
environment; however, these algorithms cannot be applied directly to 
data streams, which are an important type of big data. In general, 
local outlier detection algorithms for data streams are still 
deficient and better algorithms need to be developed that can 
effectively analyze the high velocity of data streams to detect local 
outliers. This paper presents a literature review of local outlier 
detection algorithms in static and stream environments, with an 
emphasis on LOF algorithms. It collects and categorizes existing local 
outlier detection algorithms and analyzes their characteristics. 
Furthermore, the paper discusses the advantages and limitations of 
those algorithms and proposes several promising directions for 
developing improved local outlier detection methods for data 
streams.},

required to thwart evolving cybersecurity threats. Historically, 
traditional enterprise networks have been researched extensively in 
this regard. However, the cyber threat landscape has grown to include 
wireless networks. In this article, the authors present a novel model 
that can be trained on completely different feature sets and applied 
to two distinct intrusion detection applications: traditional 
enterprise networks and 802.11 wireless networks. This is the first 
method that demonstrates superior performance in both aforementioned 
applications. The model is based on a one-versus-all binary framework 
comprising multiple nested sub-ensembles. To provide good 
generalization ability, each sub-ensemble contains a collection of 
sub-learners, and only a portion of the sub-learners implement 
boosting. A class weight based on the sensitivity metric 
(true-positive rate), learned from the training data only, is assigned 
to the sub-ensembles of each class. The use of pruning to remove 
sub-learners that do not contribute to or have an adverse effect on 
overall system performance is investigated as well. The results 
demonstrate that the proposed system can achieve exceptional 
performance in applications to both traditional enterprise intrusion

reason, energy savings turn to be critical in green software systems. 
In this paper the relationship between the usability evaluations of 
the GUIs and the power consumption measurements of the main components 
of a PC were analysed. A set of 5 web-based personal health records 
(PHRs) were selected as a case study. The usability assessment was 
performed by an expert, employing the 14 principles of design by Alan 
Dix as heuristics. They were scored on a Likert scale after performing 
a collection of common tasks in the PHRs. At the same time, an 
equipment to measure the energy consumption of hard disk drive, 
graphics card, processor, monitor and power supply was used. 
Spearman{\rq}s index was studied for the correlations between the 
usability assessments and the power consumption measurements. As a 
results, some weak relationships were found. A total of 5 usability 
heuristics were observed to may influence energy consumption when they 
were considered in the implementation of the PHRs. These heuristics 
were the following ones: consistency, task migratability, 
observability, recoverability and responsiveness. Based on the 
results, the usability principles of design cannot always be related 
to lower energy consumption. Future research should focus on the 
tradeoffs between usability and power consumption of client

behave stochastically, for example, when inputs, message delays, or 
failures conform to a probability distribution. However, reasoning 
analytically about the behavior of complex stochastic systems is 
generally infeasible. While simulations of systems are commonly used 
in engineering practice, they have not traditionally been used to 
reason about formal specifications. Statistical model checking (SMC) 
addresses this weakness by using a simulation-based approach to reason 
about precise properties specified in a stochastic temporal logic. A 
specification for a communication system may state that within some 
time bound, the probability that the number of messages in a queue 
will be greater than 5 must be less than 0.01. Using SMC, executions 
of a stochastic system are first sampled, after which statistical 
techniques are applied to determine whether such a property holds. 
While the output of sample-based methods are not always correct, 
statistical inference can quantify the confidence in the result 
produced. In effect, SMC provides a more widely applicable and 
scalable alternative to analysis of properties of stochastic systems 
using numerical and symbolic methods. SMC techniques have been 
successfully applied to analyze systems with large state spaces in 
areas such as computer networking, security, and systems biology. In

appropriately affectionate, or superficially unaffectionate 
(emphasizing positivity, contingency, and challenge, respectively).

individual to protect his or her physical, mental, and cognitive 
health and maintain his or her quality of life. The most durative of

influence on a person{\rq}s fuctional, behavioral, and cognitive

algorithm to detect the microscopic states of sleep that fundamentally 
constitute the components of good and bad sleeping behaviors and thus 
help shape the formative assessment of sleep quality. Our initial 
analysis includes the investigation of several classification 
techniques to identify and correlate the relationship of microscopic 
sleep states with overall sleep behavior. Subsequently, we also 
propose an online algorithm based on change point detection to process 
and classify the microscopic sleep states. We also develop a 
lightweight version of the proposed algorithm for real-time sleep 
monitoring, recognition, and assessment at scale. For a larger 
deployment of our proposed model across a community of individuals, we 
propose an active-learning-based methodology to reduce the effort of

    abstract = {The way users manage access to their information and 
computers has a tremendous effect on the overall security and privacy 
of individuals and organizations. Usually, access management is 
conducted using a choice architecture, a behavioral economics concept 
that describes the way decisions are framed to users. Studies have 
consistently shown that the design of choice architectures, mainly the 
selection of default options, has a strong effect on the final 
decisions users make by nudging them toward certain behaviors. In this 
article, we propose a method for optimizing access control choice 
architectures in online social networks. We empirically evaluate the 
methodology on Facebook, the world's largest online social network, by 
measuring how well the default options cover the existing user choices 
and preferences and toward which outcome the choice architecture 
nudges users. The evaluation includes two parts: (a) collecting access 
control decisions made by 266 users of Facebook for a period of 3 
months; and (b) surveying 533 participants who were asked to express 
their preferences regarding default options. We demonstrate how 
optimal defaults can be algorithmically identified from users{\rq} 
decisions and preferences, and we measure how existing defaults 
address users{\rq} preferences compared with the optimal ones. We 
analyze how access control defaults can better serve existing users, 
and we discuss how our method can be used to establish a common

    abstract = {Software-defined networking (SDN) decouples the 
control and data planes of traditional networks, logically 
centralizing the functional properties of the network in the SDN 
controller. While this centralization brought advantages such as a 
faster pace of innovation, it also disrupted some of the natural 
defenses of traditional architectures against different threats. The 
literature on SDN has mostly been concerned with the functional side, 
despite some specific works concerning non-functional properties such 
as security or dependability. Though addressing the latter in an 
ad-hoc, piecemeal way may work, it will most likely lead to efficiency 
and effectiveness problems.We claim that the enforcement of 
non-functional properties as a pillar of SDN robustness calls for a 
systemic approach. We further advocate, for its materialization, the 
reiteration of the successful formula behind SDN: {\lq}logical 
centralization{\rq}. As a general concept, we propose anchor, a 
subsystem architecture that promotes the logical centralization of 
non-functional properties. To show the effectiveness of the concept, 
we focus on security in this article: we identify the current security 
gaps in SDNs and we populate the architecture middleware with the 
appropriate security mechanisms in a global and consistent manner. 
Essential security mechanisms provided by anchor include reliable 
entropy and resilient pseudo-random generators, and protocols for 
secure registration and association of SDN devices.We claim and 
justify in the article that centralizing such mechanisms is key for 
their effectiveness by allowing us to define and enforce global 
policies for those properties; reduce the complexity of controllers 
and forwarding devices; ensure higher levels of robustness for 
critical services; foster interoperability of the non-functional 
property enforcement mechanisms; and promote the security and 
resilience of the architecture itself. We discuss design and 
implementation aspects, and we prove and evaluate our algorithms and 
mechanisms, including the formalisation of the main protocols and the 
verification of their core security properties using the Tamarin 
prover.},

protecting personal data in a transnational context to an apex. Using 
a real case where the personal data of an international traveler was 
illegally released by Chinese media, this Article identifies three 
trends that have emerged at each stage of conflict-of-laws analysis 
for lex causae: (1) The EU, the US, and China characterize the right 
to personal data differently; (2) the spread-out unilateral applicable 
law approach comes from the fact that all three jurisdictions either 
consider the law for personal data protection as a mandatory law or 
adopt connecting factors leading to the law of the forum; and (3) the 
EU and China strongly advocate deAmericanization of substantive data 
protection laws. The trends and their dynamics provide valuable 
implications for developing the choice of laws for transnational 
personal data. First, this finding informs parties that jurisdiction 
is a predominant issue in data breach cases because courts and 
regulators would apply the law of the forum. Second, currently, there 
is no international treaty or model law on choice-of-law issues for 
transnational personal data. International harmonization efforts will 
be a long and difficult journey considering how the trends demonstrate 
not only the states{\rq} irreconcilable interests but also how states 
may consider these interests as their fundamental values that they do 
not want to trade off. Therefore, for states and international 
organizations, a feasible priority is to achieve regional coordination

mask their true identity, impersonate people of high authority, or use 
identity deception and obfuscation tactics to avoid detection and

is used to identify individuals by their writing styles without

    abstract = {Byzantine fault-tolerant state-machine replication 
(BFT-SMR) is a technique for hardening systems to tolerate arbitrary 
faults. Although robust, BFT-SMR protocols are very costly in terms of 
the number of required replicas (3f+1 to tolerate f faults) and of 
exchanged messages. However, with "hybrid" architectures, where 
"normal" components trust some "special" components to provide 
properties in a trustworthy manner, the cost of using BFT can be 
dramatically reduced. Unfortunately, even though such hybridization 
techniques decrease the message/time/space complexity of BFT 
protocols, they also increase their structural complexity.  Therefore, 
we introduce Asphalion, the first theorem prover-based framework for 
verifying implementations of hybrid systems and protocols. It relies 
on three novel languages: (1) HyLoE: a Hybrid Logic of Events to 
reason about hybrid fault models; (2) MoC: a Monadic Component 
language to implement systems as collections of interacting hybrid 
components; and (3) LoCK: a sound Logic of events-based Calculus of 
Knowledge to reason about both homogeneous and hybrid systems at a 
high-level of abstraction (thereby allowing reusing proofs, and 
capturing the high-level logic of distributed systems). In addition, 
Asphalion supports compositional reasoning, e.g., through mechanisms 
to lift properties about trusted-trustworthy components, to the level 
of the distributed systems they are integrated in. As a case study, we 
have verified crucial safety properties (e.g., agreement) of several 
implementations of hybrid protocols.},

challenges for organisations to protect their information technology 
assets has made adherence to organisational security control processes

Drawing insight from organisational theory literature, we develop a 
multi-theory model, combining the elements of the theory of planned 
behaviour, competing value framework, and technology---organisational 
and environmental theory to examine how the organisational mechanisms 
interact with espoused cultural values and employee cognitive belief 
to influence cybersecurity control procedures. Using a structured 
questionnaire, we deployed structural equation modelling (SEM) to 
analyse the survey data obtained from public sector information 
technology organisations in Nigeria to test the hypothesis on the 
relationship of socio-organisational mechanisms and techno-cultural 
factors with other key determinants of employee security behaviour. 
The results showed that knowledge of cybersecurity and employee 
cognitive belief significantly influence the employees{\rq} intentions 
to comply with organisational cybersecurity control mechanisms. The 
research further noted that the influence of organisational elements 
such as leadership on employee security behaviour is mediated by 
espoused cultural values while the impact of employee cognitive belief 
is moderated by security technologies. For effective cybersecurity 
compliance, leaders and policymakers are therefore to promote 
organisational security initiatives that ensure incorporation of 
cybersecurity principles and practices into job descriptions, 
routines, and processes. This study contributes to behavioural 
security research by highlighting the critical role of leadership and 
cultural values in fostering organisational adherence to prescribed

(e.g., locations, occupations, and interests) of online social network 
users. Our attacks leverage seemingly innocent user information that 
is publicly available in online social networks to infer missing 
attributes of targeted users. Given the increasing availability of 
(seemingly innocent) user information online, our results have serious 
implications for Internet privacy---private attributes can be inferred 
from users{\rq} publicly available data unless we take steps to 
protect users from such inference attacks. To infer attributes of a 
targeted user, existing inference attacks leverage either the 
user{\rq}s publicly available social friends or the user{\rq}s 
behavioral records (e.g., the web pages that the user has liked on 
Facebook, the apps that the user has reviewed on Google Play), but not 
both. As we will show, such inference attacks achieve limited success 
rates. However, the problem becomes qualitatively different if we 
consider both social friends and behavioral records. To address this 
challenge, we develop a novel model to integrate social friends and 
behavioral records, and design new attacks based on our model. We 
theoretically and experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of our 
attacks. For instance, we observe that, in a real-world large-scale 
dataset with 1.1 million users, our attack can correctly infer the 
cities a user lived in for 57\% of the users; via confidence 
estimation, we are able to increase the attack success rate to over 
90\% if the attacker selectively attacks half of the users. Moreover, 
we show that our attack can correctly infer attributes for 
significantly more users than previous attacks.},

of students against problems such as on-campus bullying and physical 
abuse. In the UK, a report by the Office for Education (OfE) showed 
17\% of young people had been bullied during 2017--2018. This problem 
continues to prevail with consequences including depression, anxiety, 
suicidal thoughts, and eating disorders. Additionally, recent evidence 
suggests this type of victimisation could intensify existing health 
complications. This study investigates the opportunities provided by 
Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) data towards next-generation 
safeguarding. A new model is developed based on blockchain technology 
to enable real-time intervention triggered by IoMT data that can be 
used to detect stressful events, e.g., when bullying takes place. The 
model utilises private permissioned blockchain to manage IoMT data to 
achieve quicker and better decision-making while revolutionising 
aspects related to compliance, double-entry, confidentiality, and 
privacy. The feasibility of the model and the interaction between the 
sensors and the blockchain was simulated. To facilitate a close 
approximation of an actual IoMT environment, we clustered and 
decomposed existing medical sensors to their attributes, including 
their function, for a variety of scenarios. Then, we demonstrated the 
performance and capabilities of the emulator under different loads of 
sensor-generated data. We argue to the suitability of this emulator

    abstract = {With the rapid growth of connectivity and autonomy for 
today{\rq}s automobiles, their security vulnerabilities are becoming 
one of the most urgent concerns in the automotive industry. The lack 
of message authentication in Controller Area Network (CAN), which is 
the most popular in-vehicle communication protocol, makes it 
susceptible to cyber attack. It has been demonstrated that the remote 
attackers can take over the maneuver of vehicles after getting access 
to CAN, which poses serious safety threats to the public.To mitigate 
this issue, we propose a novel intrusion detection system (IDS), 
called BTMonitor (Bit-time-based CAN Bus Monitor). It utilizes the 
small but measurable discrepancy of bit time in CAN frames to 
fingerprint their sender Electronic Control Units (ECUs). To reduce 
the requirement for high sampling rate, we calculate the bit time of 
recessive bits and dominant bits, respectively, and extract their 
statistical features as fingerprint. The generated fingerprint is then 
used to detect intrusion and pinpoint the attacker. BTMonitor can 
detect new types of masquerade attack that the state-of-the-art 
clock-skew-based IDS is unable to identify. We implement a prototype 
system for BTMonitor using Xilinx Spartan 6 FPGA for data collection. 
We evaluate our method on both a CAN bus prototype and a real vehicle. 
The results show that BTMonitor can correctly identify the sender with 
an average probability of 99.76\% on the real vehicle.},

passive design, energy-efficient structures and materials, or by 
optimizing their operational energy use. In each of these areas, 
efficiency can be improved if the physical properties of the building 
along with its dynamic behavior can be captured using low-cost 
embedded sensor devices. This opens up a new challenge of installing 
and maintaining the sensor devices for different types of buildings. 
In this article, we propose BuildSense, a sensing framework for 
fine-grained, long-term monitoring of buildings using a mix of 
physical and virtual sensors. It not only reduces the deployment and 
management cost of sensors but can also guarantee accurate and 
fault-tolerant data coverage for long-term use. We evaluate BuildSense 
using sensor measurements from two rammed-earth houses that were 
custom-designed for a challenging hot-arid climate so almost no 
artificial heating or cooling is required. We demonstrate that 
BuildSense can significantly reduce the cost of permanent physical 
sensors while still achieving fit-for-purpose accuracy, 
fault-tolerance, and stability. Overall, we were able to reduce the 
cost of a building sensor network by 60\% to 80\% by replacing 
physical sensors with virtual ones while still maintaining accuracy of

    abstract = {Load shedding can combat the overload of a power grid 
that may jeopardize the grid{\rq}s safety. However, disconnected 
customers may be excessively inconvenienced or even endangered. With 
the emergence of demand-response based on cyber-enabled smart meters 
and appliances, customers may participate in solving the overload by 
curtailing their demands collaboratively such that no single customers 
will have to bear a disproportionate burden of reduced usage. However, 
compliance or commitment to curtailment requests by untrusted users is 
uncertain, which causes an important safety concern. This article 
proposes a two-phase load management scheme that (i) gives customers a 
chance to curtail their demands and correct a grid{\rq}s overload when 
there are no immediate safety concerns but (ii) falls back to load 
shedding to ensure safety once the grid enters a vulnerable state. 
Extensive simulations based on a 37-bus electrical grid and traces of 
real electrical load demonstrate the effectiveness of this scheme. In 
particular, if customers are, as expected, sufficiently committed to 
the load curtailment, overloads can be resolved in real time by 
collaborative and graceful usage degradation among them, thereby 
avoiding unpleasant load shedding.},

popular deep learning and transformer language models. We aimed to 
analyze the influence of different pre-processing techniques and text

    abstract = {Computer science (CS) and its enabling technologies 
are at the heart of this information age, yet its adoption as a core 
subject by senior secondary students in Indian schools is low and has 
not reached critical mass. Though there have been efforts to create 
core curriculum standards for subjects like Physics, Chemistry, 
Biology, and Math, CS seems to have been kept outside the purview of 
such efforts leading to its marginalization. As a first step, using 
the Darmstadt model from the ITiCSE working group that provides a 
systematic categorization approach to CS education in schools, we 
coded and analyzed the CS situation for the Indian schools. Next, we 
focused on the motivation category of the Darmstadt model and 
investigated behavioral intentions of secondary school students and 
teachers from 332 schools in India. Considering the CS subject as an 
educational innovation, using Rogers{\rq} Theory of Diffusion of 
Innovations, we propose a pedagogical framework for innovation 
attributes that can significantly predict-adoption of the CS subject 
among potential-adopter students and teachers. Data was analyzed to 
answer research questions about student and teacher intentions, 
influence of gender, school management, and school location in 
adopting CS. Interestingly, girls, urban students, teachers, and 
private schools were seen favoring the adoption of CS. An important 
issue that needed to be addressed, however, was the interchangeable 
use of terms like CS, Informatics, ICT, and digital literacy. Through 
our article, we offer a promising picture of the educational policy 
directives and the academic environment in India that is rapidly 
growing and embracing CS as a core subject of study in schools. We 
also analyze the factors that influence the adoption of CS by school 
students and teachers and conclude that there is a very positive 
response for CS among educators and students in India.},

    abstract = {Advancements in CMOS technology enable the integration 
of a huge number of resources on the same system-on-chip. Managing the 
consequent growing complexity, including fault tolerance issues in 
deep submicron technologies, is a hard challenge for hardware 
designers. Self-organization may represent a viable path toward the 
development of massively parallel architectures in current and future 
technologies. This approach is progressively more studied in 
multiprocessor architectures where, however, a further mind-set shift 
in terms of programming paradigm is required.In this article, 
self-organization and self-adaptiveness are exploited for the design 
of a coprocessing unit for array computations, supporting 
floating-point arithmetic. From the experience of previous 
explorations, an architecture embodying some principle of swarm 
intelligence to pursue adaptability, scalability, and fault tolerance 
is proposed. The architecture realizes a loosely structured collection 
of hardware agents implementing fixed behavioral rules aimed at the 
best exploitation of the available resources in whatever kind of 
context without any hardware reconfiguration. Comparisons with 
off-the-shelf very long instruction word (VLIW) digital signal 
processors (DSPs) on specific tasks reveal similar performance thus 
not paying the improved robustness with performance. The multitasking 
capabilities, together with the intrinsic scalability, make this 
approach valuable for future extensions as well, especially in the 
field of neuronal networks simulators.},

that both data transmission error and regulation time depend

    abstract = {The guarantee of social stability comes from many 
aspects of life, and image information security as one of them is 
being subjected to various malicious attacks. As a means of 
information attack, image splicing forgery refers to copying some 
areas of an image to another image to hide the traces of the original 
information and leads to grave consequences. Image splicing forgery is 
extremely complex since the attributes of the two images subjected to 
the pasting and copying operations are greatly different. In order to 
solve the issue mentioned above, we propose a method by applying a 
neural learning network controlled by multiple scales (MCNL-Net) based 
on U-Net to identify whether an image has been tampered and to locate 
the tampered regions. Firstly, the learning capacity of MCNL-Net is 
enhanced by the combination of a residual propagation module and a 
residual feedback module. An ingenious strategy is designed to control 
the size of local receptive field in each building block of MCNL-Net. 
The strategy makes MCNL-Net able to achieve properties and 
superiorities of multi-scale structure and learn specified features. 
For further improving the detection performance of MCNL-Net, a block 
attention mechanism is proposed to control the advanced degree of the 
input information in each building block. In addition, a MaxBlurPool 
method is applied into image splicing forgery detection for the first 
time, preserving the shift-equivariance of a convolutional neural 
network. Through experiments, we demonstrate that MCNL-Net can achieve 
more promising results and offer stronger robustness than the 
state-of-the-art splicing forgery detection methods.},

    abstract = {Location-based services (LBSs) typically crowdsource 
geo-tagged data from mobile users. Collecting more data will generally 
improve the utility for LBS providers; however, it also leads to more 
privacy exposure of users{\rq} mobility patterns. Although the tension 
between data utility and user privacy has been recognized, there lacks 
a solution that determines how much data to collect---in both spatial 
and temporal domains---is the ``best'' for both mobile users and the 
service provider. This article proposes a strategy toward making an 
optimal tradeoff such that a user submits data only if her mobility 
privacy will not be compromised and the data utility of the LBS 
provider will be sufficiently improved. To this end, we first define 
and formulate a concept called privacy exposure, which incorporates 
both the spatial distribution and the temporal transition of a 
user{\rq}s activity points. Second, we define and quantify data 
utility in terms of spatial repetitions and temporal closeness among 
data based on an economic principle. Then, we propose a 
PRivacy-preserving and UTility-Enhancing Crowdsourcing (PRUTEC) 
algorithm to determine, on behalf of each mobile user, whether a newly 
sensed piece of data should be submitted to the LBS provider. Our 
simulation demonstrates that PRUTEC improves the data utility of the 
service provider with a much less amount of data to collect and 
reduces privacy exposure for mobile users while collecting useful data 
continuously.},

groups. It is a multifaceted phenomenon so it is important that 
researchers consider family related variables in addition to 
developmental ones. The aim of this study was to investigate whether 
moral maturity and attachment to father are associated with specific 
types of bullying experiences. Six hundred and forty eight adolescents 
(M\,=\,15.86, SD\,=\,0.94) participated in the study. Participants 
were 9th--11th grade students. The questionnaire included demographic 
information, The Revised Olweus Bully/Victim Questionnaire and 
Inventory of Parent and Peer Attachment (Father Form-Short). 
Descriptives, frequencies, Chi-square Tests, Kruskal--Wallis Test, 
Spearman correlation, and Multinomial Regression Analysis were 
executed. Students categorized by their bullying experiences as 
follows: 40.5\% (n\,=\,256) were neither bully nor victim; 13.3\% 
(n\,=\,84) were only bully; 20.3\% (n\,=\,128) only victim and 25.9\% 
(n\,=\,164) were both bully and victim. Neither bully nor victim group 
had the highest rate of not witnessing to a violent act in a lifetime. 
And this group had better scores for attachment to father and moral 
maturity than the other bully groups. Age, gender, moral maturity and 
witnessing a violent crime emerged as predictors for belonging to 
bully experience groups. Different variables must be considered as 
predictors for several bullying groups. Results imply that being 
female is a vulnerability to be a victim and prevention programs must 
support students{\rq} moral maturity. Also, screening the students for 
possible past traumatic experiences and providing psychological help 
to traumatized ones are other important implications.},

effect of failure among security constraints that collectively 
contribute to overall secure system behavior in a socio-technical 
environment. Therefore, during security certification activities, 
analysts must systematically take into account the nexus of causal 
chains that exist among security constraints imposed by regulatory 
requirements. Numerous regulatory requirements specified in natural 
language documents or listed in spreadsheets/databases do not 
facilitate such analysis. The work presented in this article outlines 
a stepwise methodology to discover and understand the multidimensional 
correlations among regulatory requirements for the purpose of 
understanding the potential for risk due to noncompliance during 
system operation. Our lattice algebraic computational model helps 
estimate the collective adequacy of diverse security constraints 
imposed by regulatory requirements and their interdependencies with 
each other in a bounded scenario of investigation. Abstractions and 
visual metaphors combine human intuition with metrics available from 
the methodology to improve the understanding of risk based on the 
level of compliance with regulatory requirements. In addition, a

    abstract = {The analysts at a cybersecurity operations center 
(CSOC) analyze the alerts that are generated by intrusion detection 
systems (IDSs). Under normal operating conditions, sufficient numbers 
of analysts are available to analyze the alert workload. For the 
purpose of this article, this means that the cybersecurity analysts in 
each shift can fully investigate each and every alert that is 
generated by the IDSs in a reasonable amount of time and perform their 
normal tasks in a shift. Normal tasks include analysis time, time to 
attend training programs, report writing time, personal break time, 
and time to update the signatures on new patterns in alerts as 
detected by the IDS. There are several disruptive factors that occur 
randomly and can adversely impact the normal operating condition of a 
CSOC, such as (1) higher alert generation rates from a few IDSs, (2) 
new alert patterns that decrease the throughput of the alert analysis 
process, and (3) analyst absenteeism. The impact of the preceding 
factors is that the alerts wait for a long duration before being 
analyzed, which impacts the level of operational effectiveness (LOE) 
of the CSOC. To return the CSOC to normal operating conditions, the 
manager of a CSOC can take several actions, such as increasing the 
alert analysis time spent by analysts in a shift by canceling a 
training program, spending some of his own time to assist the analysts 
in alert investigation, and calling upon the on-call analyst workforce 
to boost the service rate of alerts. However, additional resources are 
limited in quantity over a 14-day work cycle, and the CSOC manager 
must determine when and how much action to take in the face of 
uncertainty, which arises from both the intensity and the random 
occurrences of the disruptive factors. The preceding decision by the 
CSOC manager is nontrivial and is often made in an ad hoc manner using 
prior experiences. This work develops a reinforcement learning (RL) 
model for optimizing the LOE throughout the entire 14-day work cycle 
of a CSOC in the face of uncertainties due to disruptive events. 
Results indicate that the RL model is able to assist the CSOC manager 
with a decision support tool to make better decisions than current 
practices in determining when and how much resource to allocate when 
the LOE of a CSOC deviates from the normal operating condition.},

    abstract = {An important component of the cyber-defense mechanism 
is the adequate staffing levels of its cybersecurity analyst workforce 
and their optimal assignment to sensors for investigating the dynamic 
alert traffic. The ever-increasing cybersecurity threats faced by 
today{\rq}s digital systems require a strong cyber-defense mechanism 
that is both reactive in its response to mitigate the known risk and 
proactive in being prepared for handling the unknown risks. In order 
to be proactive for handling the unknown risks, the above workforce 
must be scheduled dynamically so the system is adaptive to meet the 
day-to-day stochastic demands on its workforce (both size and 
expertise mix). The stochastic demands on the workforce stem from the 
varying alert generation and their significance rate, which causes an 
uncertainty for the cybersecurity analyst scheduler that is attempting 
to schedule analysts for work and allocate sensors to analysts. Sensor 
data are analyzed by automatic processing systems, and alerts are 
generated. A portion of these alerts is categorized to be significant, 
which requires thorough examination by a cybersecurity analyst. Risk, 
in this article, is defined as the percentage of significant alerts 
that are not thoroughly analyzed by analysts. In order to minimize 
risk, it is imperative that the cyber-defense system accurately 
estimates the future significant alert generation rate and dynamically 
schedules its workforce to meet the stochastic workload demand to 
analyze them. The article presents a reinforcement learning-based 
stochastic dynamic programming optimization model that incorporates 
the above estimates of future alert rates and responds by dynamically 
scheduling cybersecurity analysts to minimize risk (i.e., maximize 
significant alert coverage by analysts) and maintain the risk under a 
pre-determined upper bound. The article tests the dynamic optimization 
model and compares the results to an integer programming model that 
optimizes the static staffing needs based on a daily-average alert 
generation rate with no estimation of future alert rates (static 
workforce model). Results indicate that over a finite planning 
horizon, the learning-based optimization model, through a dynamic

    abstract = {Dynamic security analysis is an important problem of 
power systems on ensuring safe operation and stable power supply even 
when certain faults occur. No matter if such faults are caused by 
vulnerabilities of system components, physical attacks, or 
cyber-attacks that are more related to cyber-security, they eventually 
affect the physical stability of a power system. Examples of the loss 
of physical stability include the Northeast Blackout of 2003 in North 
America and the 2015 system-wide blackout in Ukraine. The nonlinear 
hybrid nature, that is, nonlinear continuous dynamics integrated with 
discrete switching, and the high degree of freedom property of power 
system dynamics make it challenging to conduct the dynamic security 
analysis. In this article, we use the hybrid automaton model to 
describe the dynamics of a power system and mainly deal with the 
index-1 differential-algebraic equation models regarding the 
continuous dynamics in different discrete states. The analysis problem 
is formulated as a reachability problem of the associated hybrid 
model. A sampling-based algorithm is then proposed by integrating 
modeling and randomized simulation of the hybrid dynamics to search 
for a feasible execution connecting an initial state of the post-fault 
system and a target set in the desired operation mode. The proposed 
method enables the use of existing power system simulators for the 
synthesis of discrete switching and control strategies through 
randomized simulation. The effectiveness and performance of the 
proposed approach are demonstrated with an application to the dynamic 
security analysis of the New England 39-bus benchmark power system 
exhibiting hybrid dynamics. In addition to evaluating the dynamic 
security, the proposed method searches for a feasible strategy to 
ensure the dynamic security of the system in the face of 
disruptions.},

attacks on sensors can compromise safety and cause collisions between 
vehicles in spite of the presence of a collision avoidance module in 
the system. We then apply the approach of Dynamic Watermarking and

attack paths an attacker can follow to compromise network resources 
from the analysis of network vulnerabilities and topology. These 
representations are a powerful tool for security risk assessment. 
Bayesian inference on attack graphs enables the estimation of the risk 
of compromise to the system{\rq}s components given their 
vulnerabilities and interconnections and accounts for multi-step 
attacks spreading through the system. While static analysis considers 
the risk posture at rest, dynamic analysis also accounts for evidence 
of compromise, for example, from Security Information and Event 
Management software or forensic investigation. However, in this 
context, exact Bayesian inference techniques do not scale well. In 
this article, we show how Loopy Belief Propagation---an approximate 
inference technique---can be applied to attack graphs and that it 
scales linearly in the number of nodes for both static and dynamic 
analysis, making such analyses viable for larger networks. We 
experiment with different topologies and network clustering on 
synthetic Bayesian attack graphs with thousands of nodes to show that 
the algorithm{\rq}s accuracy is acceptable and that it converges to a 
stable solution. We compare sequential and parallel versions of Loopy 
Belief Propagation with exact inference techniques for both static and

multi-factor authentication scheme for real-time data access in 
wireless sensor networks. On the one hand, such real-time applications 
are generally security critical, and various security goals need to be 
met. On the other hand, sensor nodes and users{\rq} mobile devices are 
typically of a resource-constrained nature, and expensive 
cryptographic primitives cannot be used. In this work, we first 
revisit four foremost multi-factor authentication schemes (i.e., those

case studies to reveal the difficulties and challenges in designing a 
multi-factor authentication scheme for wireless sensor networks 
correctly. We identify the root causes for their failures in achieving 
truly multi-factor security and forward secrecy. We further propose a 
robust multi-factor authentication scheme that makes use of the 
imbalanced computational nature of the RSA cryptosystem, particularly 
suitable for scenarios where sensor nodes (but not the user{\rq}s 
device) are the main energy bottleneck. Comparison results demonstrate 
the superiority of our scheme. As far as we know, it is the first 
two-factor authentication scheme for real-time data access in WSNs

    abstract = {For decades, various concepts in security monitoring 
have been proposed. In principle, they all in common in regard to the 
monitoring of the execution behavior of a program (e.g., control-flow 
or dataflow) running on the machine to find symptoms of attacks. Among 
the proposed monitoring schemes, software-based ones are known for 
their adaptability on the commercial products, but there have been 
concerns that they may suffer from nonnegligible runtime overhead. On 
the other hand, hardware-based solutions are recognized for their high 
performance. However, most of them have an inherent problem in that 
they usually mandate drastic changes to the internal processor 
architecture. More recent ones have strived to minimize such 
modifications by employing external hardware security monitors in the 
system. However, these approaches intrinsically suffer from the 
overhead caused by communication between the host and the external 
monitor. Our solution also relies on external hardware for security 
monitoring, but unlike the others, ours tackles the communication 
overhead by using the core debug interface (CDI), which is readily 
available in most commercial processors for debugging. We build our 
system simply by plugging our monitoring hardware into the processor 
via CDI, precluding the need for altering the processor internals. To 
validate the effectiveness of our approach, we implement two 
well-known monitoring techniques on our proposed framework: dynamic 
information flow tracking and branch regulation. The experimental 
results on our FPGA prototype show that our external hardware monitors 
efficiently perform monitoring tasks with negligible performance 
overhead, mainly with thanks to the support of CDI, which helps us 
reduce communication costs substantially.},

@article{10.1145/3267808,
    abstract = {Personal data is increasingly collected and used by 
companies to tailor services to users, and to make financial, 
employment, and health-related decisions about individuals. When 
personal data is inappropriately collected or misused, however, 
individuals may experience violations of their privacy. Historically, 
government regulators have relied on the concept of risk in energy, 
aviation and medicine, among other domains, to determine the extent to 
which products and services may harm the public. To address privacy 
concerns in government-controlled information technology, government 
agencies are advocating to adapt similar risk management frameworks to 
privacy. Despite the recent shift toward a risk-managed approach for 
privacy, to our knowledge, there are no empirical methods to determine 
which personal data are most at-risk and which contextual factors 
increase or decrease that risk. To this end, we introduce an empirical 
framework in this article that consists of factorial vignette surveys 
that can be used to measure the effect of different factors and their 
levels on privacy risk. We report a series of experiments to measure 
perceived privacy risk using the proposed framework, which are based 
on expressed preferences, and which we define as an individual's 
willingness to share their personal data with others given the 
likelihood of a potential privacy harm. These experiments control for 
one or more of the six factors affecting an individual's willingness 
to share their information: data type, computer type, data purpose, 
privacy harm, harm likelihood, and individual demographic factors, 
such as age range, gender, education level, ethnicity, and household 
income. To measure likelihood, we introduce and evaluate a new 
likelihood scale based on construal level theory in psychology. The 
scale frames individual attitudes about risk likelihood based on 
social and physical distance to the privacy harm. The findings include 
predictions about the extent to which the above factors correspond to 
risk acceptance, including that perceived risk is lower for induced 
disclosure harms when compared to surveillance and insecurity harms as 
defined in Solove's Taxonomy of Privacy. We also found that 
participants are more willing to share their information when they 
perceive the benefits of sharing. In addition, we found that 
likelihood was not a multiplicative factor in computing privacy risk 
perception, which challenges conventional theories of privacy risk in 
the privacy and security community.},

    abstract = {Given a labeled dataset that contains a rare (or 
minority) class containing of-interest instances, as well as a large 
class of instances that are not of interest, how can we learn to 
recognize future of-interest instances over a continuous stream? The 
setting is different from traditional classification in that instances 
from novel minority subclasses might continually emerge over 
time---and hence is often referred as continual, life-long, or 
open-world classification. We introduce RaRecognize, which (i) 
estimates a general decision boundary between the rare class and the 
majority class, (ii) learns to recognize the individual rare 
subclasses that exist within the training data, as well as (iii) flags 
instances from previously unseen rare subclasses as newly emerging 
(i.e., novel). The learner in (i) is general in the sense that by 
construction it is dissimilar to the specialized learners in (ii), 
thus distinguishes minority from the majority without overly tuning to 
what is only seen in the training data. Thanks to this generality, 
RaRecognize ignores all future instances that it labels as majority 
and recognizes the recurring as well as emerging rare subclasses only. 
This saves effort at test time as well as ensures that the model size 
grows moderately over time as it only maintains specialized minority 
learners. Overall, we build an end-to-end system which consists of (1) 
a representation learning component that transforms data instances 
into suitable vector inputs; (2) a continual classifier that labels 
incoming instances as majority (not of interest), rare recurrent, or 
rare emerging; and (3) a clustering component that groups the rare 
emerging instances into novel subclasses for expert vetting and model 
re-training. Through extensive experiments, we show that RaRecognize 
outperforms state-of-the art baselines on three real-world datasets 
that contain documents related to corporate-risk and (natural and 
man-made) disasters as rare classes.},

supporting continuous environmental monitoring, where sensor nodes are 
deployed and must remain operational to collect and transfer data from 
the environment to a base-station. However, sensor nodes have limited 
energy in their primary power storage unit, and this energy may be 
quickly drained if the sensor node remains operational over long

result of the lack of melanin pigment which usually changes the colour 
of the skin, hair and eyes, is usually greeted with resentment in most 
African communities. In Ghana, some communities and families consider 
it a misfortune to give birth to Albinos and hence, attempts are made 
to either kill them at birth or banish them from the community. They 
are constantly abused and ridiculed by the public with derogatory 
names and social tags that serve as a form of stigmatization. 
Evidently, it is clear that the discrimination against albinos in 
Ghana are underlain by religious and cultural beliefs. This article 
takes into perspective how religious beliefs and cultural values 
contribute to the plight of albinos in Ghana and further, discusses 
how the inculturation of human rights can help mitigate the violence 
that is perpetrated against persons with albinism.},

varied network configurations and workload, and present a comparative 
performance analysis in terms of link utilization, queue size, and

temperature, skin conductance, and acceleration; wellbeing labels 
include self-reported mood, health and stress scored 0 - 100. Compared 
to the prediction performance based on hand-crafted features, the 
proposed framework achieved higher precision with a smaller number of

    abstract = {Wagner{\rq}s vaunted model of artistic synthesis 
persists in scholarly assessments of his work. But at its centre, the 
composer argued that the media of voice and orchestra do not mix: they 
retain their identities as separate channels of sound that can neither 
duplicate nor substitute for one another. Taking as a starting point 
Wagner{\rq}s claims for the non-adaptability of media, this article 
addresses the adaptation of Wagner{\rq}s music to the modern digital 
technologies of HD cinema and video game. Drawing on a wide circle of 
writers, from Schiller and {\v Z}i{\v z}ek to Bakhtin, Aug{\'e}, 
Baudrillard and second-generation media theorists, it interrogates the 
concept of {\lq}reality{\rq} within live acoustic performance, both 
historically, as a discursive concept, and technologically, via the 
sensory realism of digital simulcasting and telepresence. The 
philosophical opposition of appearance and reality fails when reality 
is defined by the intimate simulation of a sensory event as it is 
registered on the body. And by contrasting the traditions of high 
fidelity in (classical) sound recording with that of rendering sound 
in cinema, I suggest ways in which unmixable media appear to have an 
afterlife in modern technologies. This raises questions -- in a 
post-Benjamin, post-McLuhan context -- about our definition of 
{\lq}liveness{\rq}, the concept of authenticity within mediatised and 
acoustic sounds, and our vulnerability to the technological effects of 
media.},

    abstract = {In biology, a vaccine is a weakened strain of a virus 
or bacterium that is intentionally injected into the body for the 
purpose of stimulating antibody production. Inspired by this idea, we 
propose a packet vaccine mechanism that randomizes address-like 
strings in packet payloads to carry out fast exploit detection and 
signature generation. An exploit with a randomized jump address 
behaves like a vaccine: it will likely cause an exception in a 
vulnerable program{\rq}s process when attempting to hijack the control 
flow, and thereby expose itself. Taking that exploit as a template, 
our signature generator creates a set of new vaccines to probe the 
program in an attempt to uncover the necessary conditions for the 
exploit to happen. A signature is built upon these conditions to 
shield the underlying vulnerability from further attacks. In this way, 
packet vaccine detects exploits and generates signatures in a 
black-box fashion, that is, not relying on the knowledge of a 
vulnerable program{\rq}s source and binary code. Therefore, it even 
works on the commodity software obfuscated for the purpose of 
copyright protection. In addition, since our approach avoids the 
expense of tracking the program{\rq}s execution flow, it performs 
almost as fast as a normal run of the program and is capable of 
generating a signature of high quality within seconds or even 
subseconds. We present the design of the packet vaccine mechanism and 
an example of its application. We also describe our proof-of-concept

cost considerations make network providers less inclined to take 
robustness measures against failures that are unlikely to manifest,

elementary figure of predetermined size---whose destruction would lead 
to the highest network disruption. We determine that only a 
polynomial, in the input, number of nontrivial positions for such a 
figure needs to be considered and propose a corresponding 
polynomial-time algorithm. In addition, we consider region-aware 
network augmentation to decrease the impact of a regional failure. We 
subsequently address the region-disjoint paths problem, which asks for 
two paths with minimum total weight between a source (s) and a 
destination (d) that cannot both be cut by a single regional failure 
of diameter D (unless that failure includes s or d). We prove that 
deciding whether region-disjoint paths exist is NP-hard and propose a 
heuristic region-disjoint paths algorithm.},

    abstract = {Flux is a platform for dynamically reconfigurable 
crowd-sensing using mobile devices like smartphones and tablets, 
programmed under a notion of region-based sensing. Each region is 
defined by a set of physical constraints that determine the sensing 
scope, e.g., based on device position or other environmental 
variables, plus a set of periodic tasks that perform the actual 
sensing. The resulting behavior is inherently dynamic: as a 
device{\rq}s state changes, e.g., moves in space, it enters and/or 
leaves different regions, thereby changing the set of active tasks; 
moreover, regions can be added, deleted, and reprogrammed on-the-fly. 
Flux makes use of a domain-specific language for sensing tasks that is 
compiled into abstract bytecode, later executed by a low-footprint 
virtual machine within a device, guaranteeing runtime safety by 
construction. For region/task dissemination, Flux employs a broker 
that holds a changeable region configuration plus gateways that mirror 
the configuration throughout different network access points to which 
devices connect. Sensing data is streamed by devices to gateways and 
then back to the broker. Live or archived data streams are in turn fed 
by the broker to data-processing clients, which interface with the 
broker using a publish/subscribe API. We conducted two case-study 
experiments illustrating Flux: a single-region deployment to monitor 
WiFi signal quality, and a multi-region deployment to monitor noise, 
temperature, and places-of-interest based on device movement.},

abstract:This paper focuses on risk organizations in banks and 
specifically the risk management function of banks. In order to 
forecast the future dynamics and expectations of stakeholders, the 
milestones of risk management are analyzed based on relevant 
literature. The development of banking risk management over the last 
ten years has been a response to the direct financial impact of the 
crisis and to the regulatory agenda that followed. This study argues 
that a new hybrid type of banking system, in which financial 
engineering and the integration of products and services from outside 
suppliers play a greater role than ever before, is emerging. After the 
global financial crisis, particularly banks{\rq} risk organizations 
have grown as they have reshaped themselves by going beyond the 
management of traditional financial risks. In addition, banks{\rq} 
balance sheets and funding strategies have changed dramatically since 
2007, with higher (equity) capital ratios and more stable debt 
funding. In this context, banks attach special importance to risk 
organization, risk culture and control activities in order to develop 
risk intelligence.},

    abstract = {Trust in a microelectronics-based system can be 
characterized as the level of confidence that a system is free of 
subversive alterations made during system development, or that the 
development process of a system has not been manipulated by a 
malicious adversary. Trust in systems has become an increasing concern 
over the past decade. This article presents a novel game-theoretic 
framework, called GPLADD (Graph-based Probabilistic Learning Attacker 
and Dynamic Defender), for analyzing and quantifying system 
trustworthiness at the end of the development process, through the 
analysis of risk of development-time system manipulation. GPLADD 
represents attacks and attacker-defender contests over time. It treats 
time as an explicit constraint and allows incorporating the 
informational asymmetries between the attacker and defender into 
analysis. GPLADD includes an explicit representation of attack steps 
via multi-step attack graphs, attacker and defender strategies, and 
player actions at different times. GPLADD allows quantifying the 
attack success probability over time and the attacker and defender 
costs based on their capabilities and strategies. This ability to 
quantify different attacks provides an input for evaluation of trust 
in the development process. We demonstrate GPLADD on an example attack 
and its variants. We develop a method for representing success 
probability for arbitrary attacks and derive an explicit analytic 
characterization of success probability for a specific attack. We 
present a numeric Monte Carlo study of a small set of attacks, 
quantify attack success probabilities, attacker and defender costs, 
and illustrate the options the defender has for limiting the attack 
success and improving trust in the development process.},

operations only. To address this challenge, we have designed and 
developed GraphOne, a graph data store that abstracts the graph data 
store away from the specialized systems to solve the fundamental 
research problems associated with the data store design. It combines 
two complementary graph storage formats (edge list and adjacency list) 
and uses dual versioning to decouple graph computations from updates. 
Importantly, it presents a new data abstraction, GraphView, to enable 
data access at two different granularities of data ingestions (called 
data visibility) for concurrent execution of diverse classes of 
real-time graph analytics with only a small data duplication. 
Experimental results show that GraphOne is able to deliver 
11.40\texttimes{} and 5.36\texttimes{} average speedup in ingestion 
rate against LLAMA and Stinger, the two state-of-the-art dynamic graph 
systems, respectively. Further, they achieve an average speedup of 
8.75\texttimes{} and 4.14\texttimes{} against LLAMA and 
12.80\texttimes{} and 3.18\texttimes{} against Stinger for BFS and 
PageRank analytics (batch version), respectively. GraphOne also gains 
over 2,000\texttimes{} speedup against Kickstarter, a state-of-the-art 
stream analytics engine in ingesting the streaming edges and 
performing streaming BFS when treating first half as a base snapshot 
and rest as streaming edge in a synthetic graph. GraphOne also 
achieves an ingestion rate of two to three orders of magnitude higher 
than graph databases. Finally, we demonstrate that it is possible to 
run concurrent stream analytics from the same data store.},

@article{10.1145/3177751,
    abstract = {Drones are widely used for various purposes such as 
delivery, aerial photography, and surveillance. Considering the 
increasing drone-related services, tracking the locations of drones 
can cause security threats such as escaping from drone surveillance, 
disturbing drone-related services, and capturing drones. For 
wirelessly monitoring the status of drones, telemetry is used, and 
this status information contains various data such as latitude and 
longitude, calibrated sensor outputs, and sensor offsets. Because most 
of the telemetry implementation supports neither authentication nor 
encryption, an attacker can obtain the status information of the 
drones by using an appropriate wireless communication device such as 
software-defined radio. While the attacker knows the locations of the 
drones from the status information, this information is not sufficient 
for tracking drones because the status information does not include 
any identity information that can bind the identity of the drone with 
its location.In this article, we propose a fingerprinting method for 
drones in motion for the binding of the identity of the drone with its 
location. Our fingerprinting method is based on the sensor outputs 
included in the status information, i.e., the offsets of micro-electro 
mechanical systems (MEMS) gyroscope, an essential sensor for 
maintaining the attitude of drones. We found that the offsets of MEMS 
gyroscopes are different from each other because of manufacturing 
mismatches, and the offsets of five drones obtained through their 
telemetry are distinguishable and constant during their flights. To 
evaluate the performance of our fingerprinting method on a larger 
scale, we collected the offsets from 70 stand-alone MEMS gyroscopes to 
generate fingerprints. Our experimental results show that, when using 
the offsets of three and two axes calculated from 128 samples of the 
raw outputs per axis as fingerprints, the F-scores of the proposed 
method reach 98.78\% and 94.47\%, respectively. The offsets collected 
after a month are also fingerprinted with F-scores of 96.58\% and 
78.45\% under the same condition, respectively. The proposed 
fingerprinting method is effective, robust, and persistent. 
Additionally, unless the MEMS gyroscope is not replaced, our 
fingerprinting method can be used for drone tracking even when the 
target drones are flying.},

@article{10.1145/2514641.2514643,
    abstract = {The field of modern control theory and the systems 
used to implement these controls have shown rapid development over the 
last 50 years. It was often the case that those developing control 
algorithms could assume the computing medium was solely dedicated to 
the task of controlling a plant, for example, the control algorithm 
being implemented in software on a dedicated Digital Signal Processor 
(DSP), or implemented in hardware using a simple dedicated 
Programmable Logic Device (PLD). As time progressed, the drive to 
place more system functionality in a single component (reducing power, 
cost, and increasing reliability) has made this assumption less often 
true. Thus, it has been pointed out by some experts in the field of 
control theory (e.g., Astrom) that those developing control algorithms 
must take into account the effects of running their algorithms on 
systems that will be shared with other tasks. One aspect of the work 
presented in this article is a hardware architecture that allows 
control developers to maintain this simplifying assumption. We focus 
specifically on the Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller. 
An on-chip coprocessor has been implemented that can scale to support 
servicing hundreds of plants, while maintaining microsecond-level 
response times, tight deterministic control loop timing, and allowing 
the main processor to service noncontrol tasks.In order to control a 
plant, the controller needs information about the plant's state. 
Typically this information is obtained from sensors with which the 
plant has been instrumented. There are a number of common computations 
that may be performed on this sensor data before being presented to 
the controller (e.g., averaging and thresholding). Thus in addition to 
supporting PID algorithms, we have developed a Sensor Processing Unit 
(SPU) that off-loads these common sensor processing tasks from the 
main processor.We have prototyped our ideas using Field Programmable 
Gate Array (FPGA) technology. Through our experimental results, we 
show our PID execution unit gives orders of magnitude improvement in 
response time when servicing many plants, as compared to a standard 
general software implementation. We also show that the SPU scales much 
better than a general software implementation. In addition, these 
execution units allow the simplifying assumption of dedicated 
computing medium to hold for control algorithm development.},

features has gained prominence recently. The tamper-resistant hardware 
metrics prove to be a better security feature than the high-level 
software metrics, which can be easily obfuscated. Hardware Performance 
Counters (HPC), which are inbuilt in most of the recent processors, 
are often the choice of researchers amongst hardware metrics. However, 
a lack of determinism in their counts, thereby affecting the malware 
detection rate, minimizes the advantages of HPCs. To overcome this 
problem, in our work, we propose a three-step methodology for 
fine-grained malware detection. In the first step, we extract the HPCs 
of each system call of an unknown program. Later, we make a 
dimensionality reduction of the fine-grained data to identify the 
components that have maximum variance. Finally, we use a machine 
learning based approach to classify the nature of the unknown program 
into benign or malicious. Our proposed methodology has obtained a 
98.4\% detection rate, with a 3.1\% false positive. It has improved 
the detection rate significantly when compared to other recent works

    abstract = {Many fabrication-less design houses are outsourcing 
their designs to third-party foundries for fabrication to lower cost. 
This IC development process, however, raises serious security concerns 
on Hardware Trojans (HTs). Many design-for-trust techniques have been 
proposed to detect HTs through observing erroneous output or abnormal 
side-channel characteristics. Side-channel characteristics such as 
path delay have been widely used for HT detection and functionality 
verification, as the changes of the characteristics of the host 
circuit incurred by the inserted HT can be identified through proper 
methods.In this article, for the first time, we propose a two-phase 
technique, which uses the order of the path delay in path pairs to 
detect HTs. In the design phase, a full-cover path set that covers all 
the nets of the design is generated; meanwhile, in the set, the 
relative order of paths in path pairs is determined according to their 
delay. The order of the paths in path pairs serves as the fingerprint 
of the design. In the test phase, the actual delay of the paths in the 
full-cover set is extracted from the fabricated circuits, and the 
order of paths in path pairs is compared with the fingerprint 
generated in the design phase. A mismatch between them indicates the 
existence of HTs. Both process variations and measurement noise are 
taken into consideration. The efficiency and accuracy of the proposed 
technique are confirmed by a series of experiments, including the 
examination of both violated path pairs incurred by HTs and their 
false alarm rate.},

provided a highly publicized example of a cyber attack that physically 
damaged an industrial control system. This raised public awareness 
about the possibility of similar attacks against other industrial 
targets---including critical infrastructure. In this article, we use 
hypergames to analyze how strategic perturbations of sensor readings 
and calibrated parameters can be used to manipulate a system that 
employs optimal control. Hypergames form an extension of game theory 
that enables us to model strategic interactions where the players may 
have significantly different perceptions of the game(s) they are 
playing. Past work with hypergames has focused on relatively simple 
interactions consisting of a small set of discrete choices for each 
player. Here, we apply single-stage hypergames to larger systems with 
continuous variables. We find that manipulating constraints can be a 
more effective attacker strategy than manipulating objective function 
parameters. Moreover, the attacker need not change the underlying 
system to carry out a successful attack---it may be sufficient to 
deceive the defender controlling the system. It is possible to scale 
our approach up to even larger systems, but this will depend on the

self-awareness can develop over time in systems as they do in humans. 
Furthermore, we propose that this could have the same benefits for 
networks of systems that it has had for communities of humans,

the growth of terrorist activities. In this context we need to 
identify and define certain important components of terrorism and some 
worth mentioning characteristics of terrorists which have greater 
imperative of the new phenomenon of globalization of terrorism. The 
immediate effects of all terrorist activities are felt and dealt at a 
local level by the native LEAs and other institutions responsible for 
disaster management. We know that there are definitional difficulties 
in explaining what terrorism is, however, lack of the constraints of 
definitional consensus doesn't mean that common characteristics of 
terrorist activities within the existing definitions of terrorism 
don't exist. This applies to all kinds of terrorism, the list of which 
is generally found in every relevant literature. The present paper is 
an attempt to identify the potential terrorist activities in Pakistan 
from policing perspective and analyses the problems and implications

    abstract = {In recent years, dynamic program analysis (DPA) has 
been widely used in various fields such as profiling, finding bugs, 
and security. However, existing solutions have their own weaknesses. 
Software solutions provide flexibility in DPA but they suffer from 
tremendous performance overhead. In contrast, core-level hardware 
engines rely on specialized integrated logics and attain extremely 
fast computation, but they have a limited functional extensibility 
because the logics are tightly coupled with the host processor. To 
mend this, a prior system-level approach utilizes an existing channel 
to integrate their hardware without necessitating the host 
architecture modification and introduced great potential in 
performance. Nevertheless, the prior work does not address the 
detailed design and implementation of the engine, which is quite 
essential to leverage the deployment on real systems. To address this, 
in this article, we propose an implementation of programmable DPA 
hardware engine, called program analysis unit (PAU). PAU is an 
application-specific instruction-set processor (ASIP) whose 
instruction set is customized to reflect common features of various 
DPA methods. With the specialized architecture and programmability of 
software, our PAU aims at fast computation and sufficient flexibility. 
In our case studies on several DPA techniques, we show that our ASIP 
approach can be successfully applicable to complex DPA schemes while 
providing hardware-backed power in performance and software-based 
flexibility in analysis. Recent experiments on our FPGA prototype 
revealed that the performance of PAU is 4.7-13.6 times faster than 
pure software DPA, and the power/area consumption is also acceptably 
small compared to today's mobile processors.},

    abstract = {Modern information and communication technologies used 
by electric power grids are subject to cyber-security threats. This 
article studies the impact of integrity attacks on real-time pricing 
(RTP), an emerging feature of advanced power grids that can improve 
system efficiency. Recent studies have shown that RTP creates a closed 
loop formed by the mutually dependent real-time price signals and 
price-taking demand. Such a closed loop can be exploited by an 
adversary whose objective is to destabilize the pricing system. 
Specifically, small malicious modifications to the price signals can 
be iteratively amplified by the closed loop, causing highly volatile 
prices, fluctuating power demand, and increased system operating cost. 
This article adopts a control-theoretic approach to deriving the 
fundamental conditions of RTP stability under basic demand, supply, 
and RTP models that characterize the essential behaviors of consumers, 
suppliers, and system operators, as well as two broad classes of 
integrity attacks, namely, the scaling and delay attacks. We show 
that, under an approximated linear time-invariant formulation, the RTP 
system is at risk of being destabilized only if the adversary can 
compromise the price signals advertised to consumers, by either 
reducing their values in the scaling attack or providing old prices to 
over half of all consumers in the delay attack. The results provide 
useful guidelines for system operators to analyze the impact of 
various attack parameters on system stability so that they may take 
adequate measures to secure RTP systems.},

factories accordingly, there are new opportunities to implement 
elements of industry 4.0 in nonthermal processing. Moreover, with 
application of Internet of things (IoT), smart control of the process, 
big data optimization, as well as sustainable production and 
monitoring, there is a new era of Internet of nonthermal food 
processing technologies (IoNTP). Nonthermal technologies include high 
power ultrasound, pulsed electric fields, high voltage electrical 
discharge, high pressure processing, UV-LED, pulsed light, e-beam, and 
advanced thermal food processing techniques include microwave 
processing, ohmic heating and high-pressure homogenization. The aim of 
this review was to bring in front necessity to evaluate possibilities 
of implementing smart sensors, artificial intelligence (AI), big data, 
additive technologies with nonthermal technologies, with the 
possibility to create smart factories together with strong emphasis on 
sustainability. This paper brings an overview on digitalization, IoT, 
additive technologies (3D printing), cloud data storage and smart 
sensors including two SWOT analysis associated with IoNTPs and 
sustainability. It is of high importance to perform life cycle 
assessment (LCA), to quantify (En)---environmental dimension; 
(So)---social dimension and (Ec)---economic dimension. SWOT analysis 
showed: potential for energy saving during food processing; optimized 
overall environmental performance; lower manufacturing cost; 
development of eco-friendly products; higher level of health and 
safety during food processing and better work condition for workers.

@article{10.1145/1721695.1721708,
    abstract = {In this article, we propose two techniques that aim to 
minimize the scheduling latency of high-priority interrupt-driven 
tasks, named the Interrupt Handler Migration (IHM) and Direct 
Interrupt Scheduling (DIS). The IHM allows the interrupt handler to be 
migrated from the interrupt handler thread to the corresponding target 
process so that additional context switch can be avoided and the cache 
hit ratio with respect to the data generated by the interrupt handler 
can be improved. In addition, the DIS allows the shortest path 
reserved for urgent interrupt-process pairs to be laid between the 
interrupt arrival and target process by dividing a series of 
interrupt-driven operations into nondeferrable and deferrable 
operations. Both the IHM and DIS can be combined in a natural way and 
can operate concurrently. These techniques can be applied to all kinds 
of interrupt handlers with no modification to them. The proposed 
techniques not only reduce the scheduling latency, but also resolve 
the interrupt-driven priority inversion problem.We implemented a 
prototype in the Linux 2.6.19 kernel after adding real-time patches. 
Experimental results show that the scheduling latency is significantly 
reduced by up to 84.2\% when both techniques are applied together. 
When the Linux OS runs on an ARM-based embedded CPU running at 200MHz, 
the scheduling latency can become as low as 30Î¼s, which is much 
closer to the hardware-specific limitations. By lowering the 
scheduling latency, the limited CPU cycles can be consumed more for 
user-level processes and less for system-level tasks, such as 
interrupt handling and scheduling.},

phrasing the messages in a humorous way, it is possible to express

themes, frames, and tropes that are important to many former Muslims, 
such as criticizing the legal restrictions of non-belief and 
countering stereotypes about non-believers. This leads to the 
following question: To what extent is humor being employed as an

religious status quo? To answer this question, the article analyzes 
numerous examples of religious-related humor during the COVID-19

a limited and covert dissent strategy, as they are only shared among

    abstract = {Existing work on pursuit-evasion problems typically 
either assumes stationary or heuristic behavior of one side and 
examines countermeasures of the other, or assumes both sides to be 
strategic which leads to a game theoretical framework. Results from 
the former often lack robustness against changes in the adversarial 
behavior, while those from the second category, typically as 
equilibrium solution concepts, may be difficult to justify: either due 
to the implied knowledge of other players' actions/beliefs and 
knowledge of their knowledge, or due to a lack of efficient dynamics 
to achieve such equilibria. In this paper, we take a different 
approach by assuming an intelligent pursuer/evader that is adaptive to 
the information available to it and is capable of learning over time 
with performance guarantee. Within this context we investigate two 
cases. In the first case we assume either the evader or the pursuer is 
aware of the type of learning algorithm used by the opponent, while in 
the second case neither side has such information and thus must try to 
learn. We show that the optimal policies in the first case have a 
greedy nature. This result is then used to assess the performance of 
the learning algorithms that both sides employ in the second case, 
which is shown to be mutually optimal and there is no loss for either 
side compared to the case when it knows perfectly the adaptive pattern 
used by the adversary and responses optimally. We further extend our 
model to study the application of jamming defense.},

    abstract = {In this article, we present a fog computing technique 
for real-time activity recognition and localization on-board wearable 
Internet of Things(IoT) devices. Our technique makes joint use of two 
light-weight analytic methods---Iterative Edge Mining(IEM) and 
Cooperative Activity Sequence-based Map Matching(CASMM). IEM is a 
decision-tree classifier that uses acceleration data to estimate the 
activity state. The sequence of activities generated by IEM is 
analyzed by the CASMM method for identifying the location. The CASMM 
method uses cooperation between devices to improve accuracy of 
classification and then performs map matching to identify the 
location. We evaluate the performance of our approach for activity 
recognition and localization of animals. The evaluation is performed 
using real-world acceleration data of cows collected during a pilot 
study at a Dairygold-sponsored farm in Kilworth, Ireland. The analysis 
shows that our approach can achieve a localization accuracy of up to 
99\%. In addition, we exploit the location-awareness of devices and 
present an event-driven communication approach to transmit data from 
the IoT devices to the cloud. The delay-tolerant communication 
facilitates context-aware sensing and significantly improves energy 
profile of the devices. Furthermore, an array-based implementation of 
IEM is discussed, and resource assessment is performed to verify its 
suitability for device-based implementation.},

    abstract = {...]we seek to generate a wider discussion in the 
field regarding a revised approach to this threat that is situated 
within a global framework of collaborative law enforcement which 
incorporates, in appropriate fashion, certain military and 
counter-terrorist strategies. The propositions we advance in support 
of a revised approach to countering transnational crime and its 
globalized web-enabled criminals include: (a) terrorism is one species 
of transnational crime; (b) the criminal justice model of arrest, 
prosecution, conviction and incarceration is a partial and 
insufficient response to transnational crime; (c) national security 
and law enforcement functions should be viewed analytically as a 
``public security'' continuum rather than disciplines separated by 
bright lines; (d) countering transnational criminal organizations 
effectively may require development of a hybrid law 
enforcement/military capacity and new strategic and tactical 
doctrines, including safeguards against abuse, to govern its 
deployment; (e) joint border management within nations and between 
them, coordinated with the private sector, is required and 
inter-agency cooperation and multilateral institutions must be 
strengthened in accordance with new international norms and (f) North 
America, a region construed as extending from Colombia to the Arctic 
and from Bermuda to Hawaii, could develop in the future, together with 
the European Union, as an initial site for a model pilot of the new 
approach. The United States National Security Council (roughly) 
estimates $1.3 Trillion to $3.3 Trillion is involved in money 
laundering perpetrated by transnational criminal enterprises; $750 
Billion to $1 Trillion in narcotics trafficking; $170 Billion to $320 
Billion in illicit firearms trafficking; $21 Billion in human 
trafficking; $500 Billion in counterfeit and pirated goods; $20 to $40 
Billion in environmental crimes including illegal wildlife trade; and 
$10 to $12 Billion in fraudulent credit card transactions. In the 
period since the end of the Cold War -- one of transition to a new 
series of geopolitical rivalries and relationships -- transnational 
criminal activity has increased significantly and the non-state 
organizations involved have grown correspondingly in power and 
influence.},

    abstract = {In the past decade, a new class of cyber-threats, 
known as ``Advanced Persistent Threat'' (APT), has emerged and has 
been used by different organizations to perform dangerous and 
effective attacks against financial and politic entities, critical 
infrastructures, and so on. To identify APT related malware early, a 
semi-automatic approach for malware samples analysis is needed. 
Recently, a malware triage step for a semi-automatic malware analysis 
architecture has been introduced. This step identifies incoming APT 
samples early, among all the malware delivered per day in the 
cyber-space, to immediately dispatch them to deeper analysis. In the 
article, the authors have built the knowledge base on known APTs 
obtained from publicly available reports. For efficiency reasons, they 
rely on static malware features, extracted with negligible delay, and 
use machine learning techniques for the identification. Unfortunately, 
the proposed solution has the disadvantage of requiring a long 
training time and needs to be completely retrained each time new APT 
samples or even a new APT class are discovered. In this article, we 
move from multi-class classification to a group of one-class 
classifiers, which significantly decreases runtime and allows higher 
modularity, while still guaranteeing precision and accuracy over 
90\%.},

interpret by reducing the number of features that explain the

side channels that arise in the context of shared event schedulers. 
Consider two processes, one of them an innocuous process (referred to 
as Alice) and the other a malicious one (referred to as Bob), using a 
common scheduler to process their jobs. There are other innocuous 
users in addition to Alice and Bob using the scheduler to process 
their jobs. Based on when his jobs get processed, Bob wishes to learn 
about the pattern (size and timing) of Alice's jobs. Depending on the 
context, knowledge of this pattern could have serious implications on 
Alice's privacy and security. For instance, shared routers can reveal 
traffic patterns, shared memory access can reveal cloud usage 
patterns, and suchlike. We present a formal framework to study the 
information leakage in shared resource schedulers using the pattern 
estimation error as a performance metric. The first-come-first-serve 
(FCFS) scheduling policy and time-division-multiple-access (TDMA) are 
identified as two extreme policies on the privacy metric, FCFS has the 
least, and TDMA has the highest. However, on performance-based 
metrics, such as throughput and delay, it is well known that FCFS 
significantly outperforms TDMA. We then derive two parameterized 
policies, accumulate and serve, and proportional TDMA, which take two 
different approaches to offer a tunable trade-off between privacy and

    abstract = {The Controller Area Network (CAN) is the most common 
network system in automotive systems. However, the standardized design 
of a CAN protocol does not consider security issues, so it is 
vulnerable to various security attacks from internal and external 
electronic devices. Recently, in-vehicle network is often connected to 
external network systems, including the Internet, and can result in an 
unwarranted third-party application becoming an attack point. Message 
Authentication CAN (MAuth-CAN) is a new centralized authentication for 
CAN system, where two dual-CAN controllers are utilized to process 
message authentication. MAuth-CAN is designed to provide an 
authentication mechanism as well as provide resilience to a message 
flooding attack and sustainably protect against a bus-off attack. This 
paper presents formal techniques to guarantee critical timing 
properties of MAuth-CAN, based on model checking, which can be also 
used for safety certificates of vehicle components, such as ISO 26262. 
Using model checking, we prove sufficient conditions that MAuth-CAN is 
resilient and sustainable against message flooding and bus-off attacks 
and provide two formal models of MAuth-CAN in timed automata that are 
applicable for formal analysis of other applications running on CAN 
bus. In addition, we discuss that the results of model checking of 
those properties are consistent with the experiment results of 
MAuth-CAN implementation.},

    abstract = {Modern urban railways extensively use computerized 
sensing and control technologies to achieve safe, reliable, and 
well-timed operations. However, the use of these technologies may 
provide a convenient leverage to cyber-attackers who have bypassed the 
air gaps and aim at causing safety incidents and service disruptions. 
In this article, we study False Data Injection (FDI) attacks against 
railway Traction Power Systems (TPSes). Specifically, we analyze two 
types of FDI attacks on the train-borne voltage, current, and position 
sensor measurements---which we call efficiency attack and safety 
attack---that (i) maximize the system{\rq}s total power consumption 
and (ii) mislead trains{\rq} local voltages to exceed given 
safety-critical thresholds, respectively. To counteract, we develop a 
Global Attack Detection (GAD) system that serializes a bad data 
detector and a novel secondary attack detector designed based on 
unique TPS characteristics. With intact position data of trains, our 
detection system can effectively detect FDI attacks on trains{\rq} 
voltage and current measurements even if the attacker has full and 
accurate knowledge of the TPS, attack detection, and real-time system 
state. In particular, the GAD system features an adaptive mechanism 
that ensures low false-positive and negative rates in detecting the 
attacks under noisy system measurements. Extensive simulations driven 
by realistic running profiles of trains verify that a TPS setup is 
vulnerable to FDI attacks, but these attacks can be detected 
effectively by the proposed GAD while ensuring a low false-positive 
rate.},

    abstract = {In a networked system, the risk of security 
compromises depends not only on each node{\rq}s security but also on 
the topological structure formed by the connected individuals, 
businesses, and computer systems. Research in network security has 
been exploring this phenomenon for a long time, with a variety of 
modeling frameworks predicting how many nodes we should expect to 
lose, on average, for a given network topology, after certain types of 
incidents. Meanwhile, the pricing of insurance contracts for risks 
related to information technology (better known as cyber-insurance) 
requires determining additional information, for example, the maximum 
number of nodes we should expect to lose within a 99.5\% confidence 
interval. Previous modeling research in network security has not 
addressed these types of questions, while research on cyber-insurance 
pricing for networked systems has not taken into account the 
network{\rq}s topology. Our goal is to bridge that gap, by providing a 
mathematical basis for the assessment of systematic risk in networked 
systems.We define a loss-number distribution to be a probability 
distribution on the total number of compromised nodes within a network 
following the occurrence of a given incident, and we provide a number 
of modeling results that aim to be useful for cyber-insurers in this 
context. We prove NP-hardness for the general case of computing the 
loss-number distribution for an arbitrary network topology but obtain 
simplified computable formulas for the special cases of star 
topologies, ER-random topologies, and uniform topologies. We also 
provide a simulation algorithm that approximates the loss-number 
distribution for an arbitrary network topology and that appears to 
converge efficiently for many common classes of topologies.Scale-free 
network topologies have a degree distribution that follows a power law 
and are commonly found in real-world networks. We provide an example 
of a scale-free network in which a cyber-insurance pricing mechanism 
that relies naively on incidence reporting data will fail to 
accurately predict the true risk level of the entire system. We offer 
an alternative mechanism that yields an accurate forecast by taking 
into account the network topology, thus highlighting the 
lack/importance of topological data in security incident reporting. 
Our results constitute important steps toward the understanding of 
systematic risk and help to contribute to the emergence of a viable 
cyber-insurance market.},

we present a systematic approach, that is, the Sensor Networks-on-Chip 
(SENoC), to collaboratively and efficiently manage on-chip 
applications and overcome reliability threats to Multiprocessor 
Systems-on-Chip (MPSoC). A hardware-software collaborative approach is 
proposed to solve soft error problems: a hardware-based on-chip sensor 
network is built for soft error detection, and a software-based 
recovery mechanism is applied for soft error correction. A two-step 
scheduling scheme is presented for reliable application and chip 
management, combining an off-line static optimization stage for 
application performance maximization and an online lightweight dynamic 
adjustment stage to handle runtime variations and exceptions. This 
strategy introduces only trivial overhead on hardware design and much 
lower overhead on software control and execution, and hence 
performance degradation and energy consumption is greatly reduced. We 
build a cycle-accurate simulator using SystemC, and verify the 
effectiveness of our technique by comparing performance with related 
techniques on several real-world applications.},

networks deliver security attacks, suffer from them, defend against 
them, and sometimes even cause them. This article is a concise 
tutorial on the large subject of networks and security, written for 
all those interested in networking, whether their specialty is 
security or not. To achieve this goal, we derive our focus and 
organization from two perspectives. The first perspective is that, 
although mechanisms for network security are extremely diverse, they 
are all instances of a few patterns. Consequently, after a pragmatic 
classification of security attacks, the main sections of the tutorial 
cover the four patterns for providing network security, of which the 
familiar three are cryptographic protocols, packet filtering, and 
dynamic resource allocation. Although cryptographic protocols hide the 
data contents of packets, they cannot hide packet headers. When users 
need to hide packet headers from adversaries, which may include the 
network from which they are receiving service, they must resort to the 
pattern of compound sessions and overlays. The second perspective 
comes from the observation that security mechanisms interact in 
important ways, with each other and with other aspects of networking, 
so each pattern includes a discussion of its interactions.},

all types of application areas, some of which belong to the safety and 
reliability critical domains. The functional correctness and design 
robustness of the embedded systems involved in such domains are 
crucial for the safety of personal/enterprise property or even human

important design concerns is essential.In this article, we approach 
embedded systems design from an integral perspective. We consider not 
only the classic real-time and quality of service requirements, but 
also the emerging security and power efficiency demands. Modern 
embedded systems are not any more developed for a fixed purpose, but 
instead designed for undertaking various processing requests. This 
leads to the concept of multimode embedded systems, in which the 
number and nature of active tasks change during runtime. Under dynamic 
situations, providing high performance along with various design 
concerns becomes a really difficult problem. Therefore, we propose a 
novel power-aware secure embedded systems design framework that 
efficiently solves the problem of runtime quality optimization with 
security and power constraints. The efficiency of our proposed 
techniques are evaluated in extensive experiments.},

remote attacker exhausts the victim{\rq}s battery via networking

literature proposes mitigation- and detection-based solutions, we 
propose to eliminate the vulnerability entirely by offloading the 
power requirements to the entity who makes the networking requests. To 
do so, we build communication channels using wireless charging signals 
(as opposed to the traditional radio-frequency signals), so that the 
communication and the power transfer are simultaneous and inseparable, 
and use the channels to build power-positive networking (PPN). PPN 
also offloads the computation-based costs to the requester, enabling 
authentication and other tasks considered too power-hungry for 
battery-operated devices. In this article, we study the energy DoS 
attack impacts on off-the-shelf embedded system platforms (Raspberry 
Pi and the ESP 8266 system-on-chip (SoC) module), present PPN, 
implement and build a Qi-charging-technology-compatible prototype, and

services offered by mobile social networks. Offering this kind of 
service requires accessing the physical position of users together 
with the access authorizations, i.e., who is authorized to access what 
information. However, these physical positions and authorizations are 
sensitive information that have to be kept secret from any adversary, 
including the service providers. As far as we know, the problem of 
offering location-based services in mobile social networks with a 
revocation feature under collusion assumption, i.e., an adversary 
colludes with the service provider, has not been studied. In this 
article, we show how to solve this problem in the example of range 
queries. Specifically, we guarantee any adversary, including the 
service provider, is not able to learn (1) the physical position of 
the users, (2) the distance between his position and that of the 
users, and (3) whether two users are allowed to learn the distance 
between them. We propose two approaches, namely, two-layer symmetric 
encryption and two-layer attribute-based encryption. The main 
difference between them is that they use, among other encryption 
schemes, symmetric and attribute-based encryption, respectively. Next, 
we prove the secrecy guarantees of both approaches, analyze their

lack awareness and control of the vulnerabilities in everyday contexts 
and need support and care in regulating disclosures to their physical

physically interruptive, socially disruptive, time-consuming and 
cumbersome. To address such challenges, we investigate the user 
interaction experience and discuss the need for more tangible and 
embodied interactions for effective and seamless natural privacy 
management in everyday UbiComp settings. We propose the Privacy Care 
interaction framework, which is rooted in the literature of privacy 
management and tangible computing. Keeping users at the center, 
Awareness and Control are established as the core parts of our 
framework. This is supported with three interrelated interaction 
tenets: Direct, Ready-to-Hand, and Contextual. Direct refers to 
intuitiveness through metaphor usage. Ready-to-Hand supports 
granularity, non-intrusiveness, and ad hoc management, through 
periphery-to-center style attention transitions. Contextual supports 
customization through modularity and configurability. Together, they 
aim to provide experience of an embodied privacy care with varied 
interactions that are calming and yet actively empowering. The 
framework provides designers of such care with a basis to refer to, to 
generate effective tangible tools for privacy management in everyday 
settings.Through five semi-structured focus groups, we explore the 
privacy challenges faced by a sample set of 15 older adults (aged 60+) 
across their cyber-physical-social spaces. The results show conformity 
to our framework, demonstrating the relevance of the facets of the

e.g., cruise control and steering assistant, have been proposed and 
deployed to improve the driving experience, passenger safety, and 
vehicle performance. Despite the existence of several novel vehicular 
applications in the literature, there still exists a significant gap 
between resources needed for a variety of vehicular (in particular, 
data-dominant, latency-sensitive, and computationally-heavy) 
applications and the capabilities of already-in-market vehicles. To 
address this gap, different smartphone-/Cloud-based approaches have 
been proposed that utilize the external computational/storage 
resources to enable new applications. However, their acceptance and 
application domain are still very limited due to programmability, 
wireless connectivity, and performance limitations, along with several 
security/privacy concerns.In this paper, we present a novel reference 
architecture that can potentially enable rapid development of various 
vehicular applications while addressing shortcomings of 
smartphone-/Cloud-based approaches. The architecture is formed around 
a core component, called SmartCore, a privacy/security-friendly 
programmable dongle that brings general-purpose computational and 
storage resources to the vehicle and hosts in-vehicle applications. 
Based on the proposed architecture, we develop an application 
development framework for vehicles, that we call ProCMotive. 
ProCMotive enables developers to build customized vehicular

    abstract = {The vision for programmable matter is to create a 
material that can be reprogrammed to have different shapes and to 
change its physical properties on demand. They are autonomous systems 
composed of a huge number of independent connected elements called 
particles. The connections to one another form the overall shape of 
the system. These particles are capable of interacting with each other 
and take decisions based on their environment. Beyond sensing, 
processing, and communication capabilities, programmable matter 
includes actuation and motion capabilities. It could be deployed in 
different domains and will constitute an intelligent component of the 
IoT. A lot of applications can derive from this technology, such as 
medical or industrial applications. However, just like any other 
technology, security is a huge concern. Given its distributed 
architecture and its processing limitations, programmable matter 
cannot handle the traditional security protocols and encryption 
algorithms. This article proposes a new security protocol optimized 
and dedicated for IoT programmable matter. This protocol is based on 
lightweight cryptography and uses the same encryption protocol as a 
hashing function while keeping the distributed architecture in mind. 
The analysis and simulation results show the efficiency of the 
proposed method and that a supercomputer will need about 5.93

@article{10.1145/3321480,
    abstract = {Vehicular cyber-physical systems (VCPS), among several 
other applications, may help address an ever-increasing challenge of 
traffic congestion in large cities. Nevertheless, VCPS can be hindered 
by information falsification problem, resulting due to the wrong 
perception of a traffic event or deliberate faking by the 
participating vehicles. Such information fabrication causes the 
re-routing of vehicles and artificial congestion, leading to economic, 
safety, environmental, and health hazards. Thus, it is imperative to 
infer truthful traffic information in real-time to restore the 
operational reliability of the VCPS. In this work, we propose a novel 
reputation scoring and decision support framework, called Spoofed and 
False Report Eradicator (SAFE), which offers a cost-effective and 
efficient solution to handle information falsification problem in the 
VCPS domain. The framework includes humans in the sensing loop by 
exploiting the paradigm of participatory sensing, a concept of a 
mobile security agent (MSA) to nullify the effects of deliberate false 
contribution, and a variant of the distance bounding mechanism to 
thwart location-spoofing attacks. A regression-based model integrates 
these effects to generate the expected truthfulness of a 
participant{\rq}s contribution. To determine if any contribution is 
true or false, a generalized linear model is used to transform the 
expected truthfulness into a Quality of Contribution (QoC) score. The 
QoC of different reports is aggregated to compute user reputation. 
Such reputation enables classification of different participation 
behaviors. Finally, an Expected Utility Theory (EUT)-based decision 
model is proposed that utilizes the reputation score to determine if 
event-specific information should be published or dropped. To evaluate 
the SAFE framework through experimental study, we used both simulated 
and real data to compare its reputation-based user segregation 
performance with state-of-the-art frameworks. Experimental results 
exhibit that SAFE captures the fine differences in participants{\rq} 
behavior through the quality and quantity of participation, and the 
accuracy of their informed location. It also significantly improves 
operational reliability through publishing the information of only 
legitimate events.},

    abstract = {Transiently Powered Computers (TPCs) are a new class 
of batteryless embedded systems that depend solely on energy harvested 
from external sources for performing computations. Enabling 
long-running computations on TPCs is a major challenge due to the 
highly intermittent nature of the power supply (often bursts of < 
100ms), resulting in frequent system reboots. Prior work seeks to 
address this issue by frequently checkpointing system state in flash 
memory, preserving it across power cycles. However, this involves a 
substantial overhead due to the high erase/write times of flash 
memory. This article proposes the use of Ferroelectric RAM (FRAM), an 
emerging nonvolatile memory technology that combines the benefits of 
SRAM and flash, to seamlessly enable long-running computations in 
TPCs. We propose a lightweight, in-situ checkpointing technique for 
TPCs using FRAM that consumes only 30nJ while decreasing the time 
taken for saving and restoring a checkpoint to only 21.06Î¼s, which is 
over two orders of magnitude lower than the corresponding overhead 
using flash. We have implemented and evaluated our technique, 
QuickRecall, using the TI MSP430FR5739 FRAM-enabled microcontroller. 
Experimental results show that our highly-efficient checkpointing 
translate to significant speedup (1.25x - 8.4x) in program execution 
time and reduction (â¼3x) in application-level energy consumption.},

    abstract = {In the age of multimedia big data, the popularity of 
mobile devices has been in an unprecedented growth, the speed of data 
increasing is faster than ever before, and Internet traffic is rapidly 
increasing, not only in volume but also in heterogeneity. Therefore, 
data processing and network overload have become two urgent problems. 
To address these problems, extensive papers have been published on 
image analysis using deep learning, but only a few works have 
exploited this approach for video analysis. In this article, a 
hybrid-stream model is proposed to solve these problems for video 
analysis. Functionality of this model covers Data Preprocessing, Data 
Classification, and Data-Load-Reduction Processing. Specifically, an 
improved Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) classification algorithm 
is designed to evaluate the importance of each video frame and video 
clip to enhance classification precision. Then, a reliable keyframe 
extraction mechanism will recognize the importance of each frame or 
clip, and decide whether to abandon it automatically by a series of 
correlation operations. The model will reduce data load to a dynamic 
threshold changed by Ï, control the input size of the video in mobile 
Internet, and thus reduce network overload. Through experimental 
simulations, we find that the size of processed video has been 
effectively reduced and the quality of experience (QoE) has not been 
lowered due to a suitably selected parameter Î·. The simulation also 
shows that the model has a steady performance and is powerful enough 
for continuously growing multimedia big data.},

    abstract = {In the area of biomedical engineering, 
digital-microfluidic biochips (DMFBs) have received considerable 
attention because of their capability of providing an efficient and 
reliable platform for conducting point-of-care clinical diagnostics. 
System reliability, in turn, mandates error-recoverability while 
implementing biochemical assays on-chip for medical applications. 
Unfortunately, the technology of DMFBs is not yet fully equipped to 
handle error-recovery from various microfluidic operations involving 
droplet motion and reaction. Recently, a number of cyber-physical 
systems have been proposed to provide real-time checking and 
error-recovery in assays based on the feedback received from a few 
on-chip checkpoints. However, to synthesize robust feedback systems 
for different types of DMFBs, certain practical issues need to be 
considered such as co-optimization of checkpoint placement, 
error-recoverability, and layout of droplet-routing pathways. For 
application-specific DMFBs, we propose here an algorithm that 
minimizes the number of checkpoints and determines their locations to 
cover every path in a given droplet-routing solution. Next, for 
general-purpose DMFBs, where the checkpoints are pre-deployed in 
specific locations, we present a checkpoint-aware routing algorithm 
such that every droplet-routing path passes through at least one 
checkpoint to enable error-recovery and to ensure physical routability 
of all droplets. Furthermore, we also propose strategies for executing 
the algorithms in reliable mode to enhance error-recoverability. The 
proposed methods thus provide reliability-hardening mechanisms for a 
wide class of cyber-physical DMFBs.},

distribution networks require monitoring of underground water pipes 
with high sample rates for precise data analysis and water network

long-range communication requirements, high transmission power is 
typically adopted to communicate high-speed sensor data streams, 
posing challenges for long-term sustainable monitoring. In this 
article, we develop the first sustainable water sensing system, 
exploiting energy harvesting opportunities from water flows. Our 
system does this by scheduling the transmission of a subset of the

autoregressive models based on the sound-velocity propagation of

FAST-DTS, a lightweight online algorithm that can adapt to arbitrary

sessions. Our analysis gives the following three major results. First, 
the maximum number of faults that can be corrected by the algorithms 
has a tight bound of âN/2 â â 1 when every node pair performs a 
synchronization session. Second, by converting the fault resilience 
problem to a graph-theoretic edge connectivity problem and applying 
Menger{\rq}s theorem, we develop an algorithm to compute the tight 
bound when not every node pair performs a synchronization session. 
Third, the number of synchronization sessions to achieve the 
capability of correcting any K faults has a lower bound of â N 
(2K+1) / 2 ââ¯; we also develop an algorithm to schedule the 
synchronization sessions to approach the lower bound. The above 
results provide basic understanding and useful guidelines to the 
design of resilient clock synchronization systems. For instance, our 
results suggest that, the four-node network achieves the highest 
degree of resilience that is defined as the ratio of the maximum 
number of correctable faults to the number of synchronization 
sessions. Therefore, by organizing a large-scale clock synchronization 
system into a hierarchy of multiple tiers with each consisting of 
four-node synchronization groups, we can achieve satisfactory and 
understood resilience against faults with reduced synchronization 
sessions.},

    abstract = {Due to the globalization of Integrated Circuit (IC) 
design in the semiconductor industry and the outsourcing of chip 
manufacturing, Third-Party Intellectual Properties (3PIPs) become 
vulnerable to IP piracy, reverse engineering, counterfeit IC, and 
hardware trojans. To thwart such attacks, ICs can be protected using 
logic encryption techniques. However, strong resilient techniques 
incur significant overheads. Side-channel attacks (SCAs) further 
complicate matters by introducing potential attacks post fabrication. 
One of the most severe SCAs is power analysis (PA) attacks, in which 
an attacker can observe the power variations of the device and analyze 
them to extract the secret key. PA attacks can be mitigated via adding 
large extra hardware; however, the overheads of such solutions can 
render them impractical, especially when there are power and area 
constraints.All Spin Logic Device (ASLD) is one of the most promising 
spintronic devices due to its unique properties: small area, no 
spin-charge signal conversion, zero leakage current, non-volatile 
memory, high density, low operating voltage, and its compatibility 
with conventional CMOS technology. In this article, we extend the work 
in Reference [1] on the usage of ASLD to produce secure and resilient 
circuits that withstand IC attacks (during the fabrication) and PA 
attacks (after fabrication), including reverse engineering attacks. 
First, we show that ASLD has another unique feature: identical power 
dissipation through the switching operations, where such properties 
can be effectively used to prevent PA and IC attacks. We then evaluate 
the proposed ASLD-based on performance overheads and security 
guarantees.},

return-oriented program chains together short instruction sequences

security measures---those that seek to prevent malicious computation 
by preventing the execution of malicious code.To demonstrate the wide 
applicability of return-oriented programming, we construct a 
Turing-complete set of building blocks called gadgets using the 
standard C libraries of two very different architectures: Linux/x86

@article{10.1145/2836168,
    abstract = {This article aims to tackle two fundamental memory 
bottlenecks: limited off-chip bandwidth (bandwidth wall) and long 
access latency (memory wall). To achieve this goal, our approach 
exploits the inherent error resilience of a wide range of 
applications. We introduce an approximation technique, called 
Rollback-Free Value Prediction (RFVP). When certain 
safe-to-approximate load operations miss in the cache, RFVP predicts 
the requested values. However, RFVP does not check for or recover from 
load-value mispredictions, hence, avoiding the high cost of pipeline 
flushes and re-executions. RFVP mitigates the memory wall by enabling 
the execution to continue without stalling for long-latency memory 
accesses. To mitigate the bandwidth wall, RFVP drops a fraction of 
load requests that miss in the cache after predicting their values. 
Dropping requests reduces memory bandwidth contention by removing them 
from the system. The drop rate is a knob to control the trade-off 
between performance/energy efficiency and output quality. Our 
extensive evaluations show that RFVP, when used in GPUs, yields 
significant performance improvement and energy reduction for a wide 
range of quality-loss levels. We also evaluate RFVP{\rq}s latency 
benefits for a single core CPU. The results show performance 
improvement and energy reduction for a wide variety of applications 
with less than 1\% loss in quality.},

have a data matrix, which is the superposition of a low-rank component

prove that under some suitable assumptions, it is possible to recover

the nuclear norm and of the \ensuremath{\ell}1 norm. This suggests the

the principal components of a data matrix even though a positive

@article{10.1145/3122985,
    abstract = {Internet security and technology policy research 
regularly uses technical indicators of abuse to identify culprits and 
to tailor mitigation strategies. As a major obstacle, current 
inferences from abuse data that aim to characterize providers with 
poor security practices often use a naive normalization of abuse 
(abuse counts divided by network size) and do not take into account 
other inherent or structural properties of providers. Even the size 
estimates are subject to measurement errors relating to attribution, 
aggregation, and various sources of heterogeneity. More precise 
indicators are costly to measure at Internet scale. We address these 
issues for the case of hosting providers with a statistical model of 
the abuse data generation process, using phishing sites in hosting 
networks as a case study. We decompose error sources and then estimate 
key parameters of the model, controlling for heterogeneity in size and 
business model. We find that 84\% of the variation in abuse counts 
across 45,358 hosting providers can be explained with structural 
factors alone. Informed by the fitted model, we systematically select 
and enrich a subset of 105 homogeneous ``statistical twins'' with 
additional explanatory variables, unreasonable to collect for all 
hosting providers. We find that abuse is positively associated with 
the popularity of websites hosted and with the prevalence of popular 
content management systems. Moreover, hosting providers who charge 
higher prices (after controlling for level differences between 
countries) witness less abuse. These structural factors together 
explain a further 77\% of the remaining variation. This calls into 
question premature inferences from raw abuse indicators about the 
security efforts of actors, and suggests the adoption of similar 
analysis frameworks in all domains where network measurement aims at 
informing technology policy.},

formalising the problem of run-time enforcement of implantable

along the following directions: (1) we develop bi-directional 
enforcement, where the enforced policies depend not only on the status 
of the pacemaker (the controller) but also of the heart (the plant), 
thus formalising the run-time enforcement problem for cyber-physical 
systems (2) we express policies using a variant of discrete timed 
automata (DTA), which can cover all regular properties unlike earlier 
frameworks limited to safety properties, (3) we are able to ensure the 
timing safety of implantable devices through the proposed enforcement, 
and (4) we show that the DTA-based approach is efficient relative to 
its dense time variant while ensuring that the discretisation error is 
relatively small and bounded. The developed approach is validated

    abstract = {Since ancient Greece, handshaking has been commonly 
practiced between two people as a friendly gesture to express trust 
and respect, or form a mutual agreement. In this article, we show that 
such physical contact can be used to bootstrap secure cyber contact 
between the smart devices worn by users. The key observation is that 
during handshaking, although belonged to two different users, the two 
hands involved in the shaking events are often rigidly connected, and 
therefore exhibit very similar motion patterns. We propose a novel key 
generation system, which harvests motion data during user handshaking 
from the wrist-worn smart devices such as smartwatches or fitness 
bands, and exploits the matching motion patterns to generate symmetric 
keys on both parties. The generated keys can be then used to establish 
a secure communication channel for exchanging data between devices. 
This provides a much more natural and user-friendly alternative for 
many applications, e.g., exchanging/sharing contact details, friending 
on social networks, or even making payments, since it doesn{\rq}t 
involve extra bespoke hardware, nor require the users to perform 
pre-defined gestures. We implement the proposed key generation system 
on off-the-shelf smartwatches, and extensive evaluation shows that it 
can reliably generate 128-bit symmetric keys just after around 1s of 
handshaking (with success rate >99\%), and is resilient to different 
types of attacks including impersonate mimicking attacks, impersonate 
passive attacks, or eavesdropping attacks. Specifically, for real-time 
impersonate mimicking attacks, in our experiments, the Equal Error 
Rate (EER) is only 1.6\% on average. We also show that the proposed 
key generation system can be extremely lightweight and is able to run 
in-situ on the resource-constrained smartwatches without incurring 
excessive resource consumption.},

    abstract = {In this article, we make the case for the new class of 
Self-aware Cyber-physical Systems. By bringing together the two 
established fields of cyber-physical systems and self-aware computing, 
we aim at creating systems with strongly increased yet managed 
autonomy, which is a main requirement for many emerging and future 
applications and technologies. Self-aware cyber-physical systems are 
situated in a physical environment and constrained in their resources, 
and they understand their own state and environment and, based on that 
understanding, are able to make decisions autonomously at runtime in a 
self-explanatory way. In an attempt to lay out a research agenda, we 
bring up and elaborate on five key challenges for future self-aware 
cyber-physical systems: (i) How can we build resource-sensitive yet 
self-aware systems? (ii) How to acknowledge situatedness and 
subjectivity? (iii) What are effective infrastructures for 
implementing self-awareness processes? (iv) How can we verify 
self-aware cyber-physical systems and, in particular, which guarantees 
can we give? (v) What novel development processes will be required to 
engineer self-aware cyber-physical systems? We review each of these 
challenges in some detail and emphasize that addressing all of them 
requires the system to make a comprehensive assessment of the 
situation and a continual introspection of its own state to sensibly 
balance diverse requirements, constraints, short-term and long-term 
objectives. Throughout, we draw on three examples of cyber-physical 
systems that may benefit from self-awareness: a multi-processor 
system-on-chip, a Mars rover, and an implanted insulin pump. These 
three very different systems nevertheless have similar 
characteristics: limited resources, complex unforeseeable 
environmental dynamics, high expectations on their reliability, and 
substantial levels of risk associated with malfunctioning. Using these 
examples, we discuss the potential role of self-awareness in both 
highly complex and rather more simple systems, and as a main 
conclusion we highlight the need for research on above listed 
topics.},

    abstract = {Provenance records the history of data acquisition and 
transmission. In wireless sensor networks (WSNs), provenance is 
critical for many different purposes, including assessing the 
trustworthiness of data acquired and forwarded by sensors, supporting 
situation awareness, and detecting early signs of attacks. However, a 
major drawback in provenance for WSNs is its size. It is thus critical 
to develop efficient techniques for provenance encoding. A major issue 
of previously proposed provenance encoding techniques is that the size 
of the provenance either expands too fast with increases in the number 
of packet transmission hops or is very sensitive to the WSN{\rq}s 
topology, i.e., the size of the provenance expands drastically with 
changes in the WSN{\rq}s topology. In this article, we propose a novel 
provenance encoding technique based on dynamic Bayesian network and 
overlapped arithmetic coding scheme, which addresses such an issue. 
Through theoretical analysis, simulation, and testbed experiments, we 
show that our scheme outperforms other WSN lightweight provenance 
schemes with respect to provenance size and energy consumption.},

Islamic State (ISIL) faced a considerable challenge: how could a force 
of fewer than 50 operators provide guidance and support to their Iraqi 
allies (mostly Iraqi Special Forces units who had been trained by U.S. 
forces prior to the U.S. withdrawal from Iraq in 2011) while also 
keeping in line with Washington{\rq}s policy of seeking to avoid any 
possibility of combat casualties among deployed U.S. Special Forces?

multi-scale behaviour is a powerful tool in many branches of science, 
yet it still presents significant challenges. Here, we consider a 
general two-layer (agent-environment) modelling framework, where 
spatially distributed agents behave according to external inputs and 
internal computation; this behaviour may include influencing their 
immediate environment, creating a medium over which agent-agent 
interaction signals can be transmitted. We propose a novel simulation 
strategy based on a statistical abstraction of the agent layer, which 
is typically the most detailed component of the model and can incur 
significant computational cost in simulation. The abstraction makes 
use of Gaussian Processes, a powerful class of non-parametric 
regression techniques from Bayesian Machine Learning, to estimate the 
agent{\rq}s behaviour given the environmental input. We show on two

    abstract = {Security games model the confrontation between a 
defender protecting a set of targets and an attacker who tries to 
capture them. A variant of these games assumes security 
interdependence between targets, facilitating contagion of an attack. 
So far, only stochastic spread of an attack has been considered. In 
this work, we introduce a version of security games, where the 
attacker strategically drives the entire spread of attack and where 
interconnections between nodes affect their susceptibility to be 
captured.We find that the strategies effective in the settings without 
contagion or with stochastic contagion are no longer feasible when 
spread of attack is strategic. While in the former settings it was 
possible to efficiently find optimal strategies of the attacker, doing 
so in the latter setting turns out to be an NP-complete problem for an 
arbitrary network. However, for some simpler network structures, such 
as cliques, stars, and trees, we show that it is possible to 
efficiently find optimal strategies of both players. For arbitrary 
networks, we study and compare the efficiency of various heuristic 
strategies. As opposed to previous works with no or stochastic 
contagion, we find that centrality-based defense is often effective 
when spread of attack is strategic, particularly for centrality 
measures based on the Shapley value.},

    abstract = {Phishing attacks, in which criminals lure Internet 
users to Web sites that spoof legitimate Web sites, are occurring with 
increasing frequency and are causing considerable harm to victims. 
While a great deal of effort has been devoted to solving the phishing 
problem by prevention and detection of phishing emails and phishing 
Web sites, little research has been done in the area of training users 
to recognize those attacks. Our research focuses on educating users 
about phishing and helping them make better trust decisions. We 
identified a number of challenges for end-user security education in 
general and anti-phishing education in particular: users are not 
motivated to learn about security; for most users, security is a 
secondary task; it is difficult to teach people to identify security 
threats without also increasing their tendency to misjudge nonthreats 
as threats. Keeping these challenges in mind, we developed an 
email-based anti-phishing education system called ``PhishGuru'' and an 
online game called ``Anti-Phishing Phil'' that teaches users how to 
use cues in URLs to avoid falling for phishing attacks. We applied 
learning science instructional principles in the design of PhishGuru 
and Anti-Phishing Phil. In this article we present the results of 
PhishGuru and Anti-Phishing Phil user studies that demonstrate the 
effectiveness of these tools. Our results suggest that, while 
automated detection systems should be used as the first line of 
defense against phishing attacks, user education offers a 
complementary approach to help people better recognize fraudulent 
emails and websites.},

subjects that fit into the idea of the ``other'' by exposing them to 
compulsory invisibility. This research{\rq}s main objective was to 
examine how demonization is used as a weapon of oppression to devalue 
specific individuals through the hashtag \#StopIslam and 
Instagram{\rq}s role in this process. The methodology used for this 
purpose has consisted of an empirical and quantitative analysis of the 
most recent (1 January 2020--31 July 2020) posts on Instagram with 
\#StopIslam, analyzing the images and the content. The study has 
determined how, through social media manipulation, erroneous ideas are 
transmitted that prevent the Islamic collective{\rq}s integration, 
especially in European countries. The conclusions will reflect hate 
speech and how the Islamic world{\rq}s demonization results in the 
Muslim community{\rq}s stigmatization, racism, and Islamophobia. 
Although there are different articles related to demonization and hate 
speech, there are not many scientific resources that explain these 
variables on Instagram and how it affects the inclusion of the Muslim 
community in Europe, significantly when the time spent on the Internet 
is growing.},

be used maliciously for criminal activity? This study examines the 
conditions under which the Internet is associated with cybercriminal 
offenses. Using comprehensive state-level data in the United States 
during 2004--2010, our findings show that there is no clear empirical 
evidence that the Internet penetration rate is related to the number 
of Internet crime perpetrators; however, cybercriminal activities are 
contingent upon socioeconomic factors and connection speed. 
Specifically, a higher income, more education, a lower poverty rate, 
and a higher inequality are likely to make the Internet penetration be 
more positively related with cybercrime perpetrators, which are indeed 
different from the conditions of terrestrial crime in the real world. 
In addition, as opposed to narrowband, the broadband connections are 
significantly and positively associated with the number of Internet 
crime perpetrators, and it amplifies the aforementioned moderating 
effects of socioeconomic status on Internet crime offenses. Taken 
together, cybercrime requires more than just a skilled perpetrator,

European tour organized by Signor Paganini between 1827 and 1843. She 
was exhibited in courts, salons and scientific cabinets, and also 
starred in a stage play in which she appeared as herself with a troupe 
of actors. In this article we try to reconstruct the modalities of 
exhibition of Azil taking as a reference a small pamphlet, republished 
several times in the years 1827-1843. The story of Azil makes a very 
interesting addition to the studies that have recently established the 
dimensions of the ethnoanthropological phenomenon of the exhibition of 
otherness. It emerges that in the Kingdom of Italy, above all in the 
liberal and fascist periods, this phenomenon was quite considerable 
and can take its place in the broader panorama of ethnoexhibitions 
featuring living human beings in Europe during the colonial and 
imperialist age. The episode we have reconstructed certainly does not 
suffice to be able to state that the exhibition of living human beings 
was common practice in Italy in the first half of the 19th century, 
but it does show how instances that originated in other European 
nations, where spectacles of this kind were more familiar, could 
readily find fortune in Italy.},

    abstract = {Image schemas are mental constructs central to human 
cognitive psychology. The neurobiological grounding of these 
structures has been suggested by experimental research both in 
non-human primates (Rizzolatti and Craighero 2004; Umilt{\'a} et al. 
2001) and lower animals (Knudsen 2002, 1998). However, their 
applicability as concrete cognitive products has not been explored yet 
in zoosemiotics. This study shows that image schemas are highly 
instrumental to making sense of the impersonations of two animals 
featured in biology research studies and wildlife documentary films: 
the mimic octopus (Thaumoctopus mimicus) and the Gibb{\rq}s sea spider 
crab (Pisa armata). In analysing the movements and postures of these 
animals, it is argued that image schemas underlie recurring patterns 
of animal bodily experience and response, which ties image-schematic 
structures to non-human intersubjectivity. In line with the 
pluralistic view of zoosemiotics (e.g. Maran, Martinelli and Turovski 
2011), this paper takes an intermediary position in the 
continuity--discontinuity debate regarding communication in humans and 
animals. In this regard, the complexity of the creative behavioural 
models of the animals examined leaves the door open for the existence 
of sophisticated mental life in non-human species.},

system of fire detectors, fire control units, automated fire 
extinguishers, and fire notification appliances. Malfunction of these 
safety-critical cyber-physical systems may lead to chaotic 
evacuations, property damage, and even loss of human life. Therefore, 
reliability is one of the most crucial factors for fire detectors. 
Indeed, even a single report of a fire cannot be ignored, considering 
the importance of early fire detection and suppression. In this 
article, we show that wide-area smoke detectors, which are globally 
installed in critical infrastructures such as airports, sports 
facilities, and auditoriums, have significant vulnerabilities in terms 
of reliability; one can remotely and stealthily induce false fire 
alarms and suppress real fire alarms with a minimal attacker 
capability using simple equipment. The practicality and 
generalizability of these vulnerabilities has been assessed based on 
the demonstration of two types of sensor attacks on two commercial 
off-the-shelf optical beam smoke detectors from different 
manufacturers. Further, the practical considerations of building 
stealthy attack equipment has been analyzed, and an extensive survey 
of almost all optical beam smoke detectors on the market has been 
conducted. In addition, we show that the current standards of the fire 
alarm network connecting the detector and a control unit exacerbate 
the problem, making it impossible or very difficult to mitigate the 
threats we found. Finally, we discuss hardware- and software-based 
possible countermeasures for both wide-area smoke detectors and the 
fire alarm network; the effectiveness of one of the countermeasures is 
experimentally evaluated.},

problem with numerous applications that has been studied in various 
forms for almost 50 years. In the simplest version of this problem, a 
user has to maintain k memorized checkpoints during a long 
computation, where the only allowed operation is to move one of the 
checkpoints from its old time to the current time, and his goal is to 
keep the checkpoints as evenly spread out as possible at all 
times.Bringmann, Doerr, Neumann, and Sliacan studied this problem as a 
special case of an online/offline optimization problem in which the 
deviation from uniformity is measured by the natural discrepancy 
metric of the worst case ratio between real and ideal segment lengths. 
They showed this discrepancy is smaller than 1.59-o(1) for all k and 
smaller than ln 4-o(1)â 1.39 for the sparse subset of k{\rq}s, which 
are powers of 2. In addition, they obtained upper bounds on the 
achievable discrepancy for some small values of k.In this article, we 
solve the main problems left open in the above-mentioned paper by 
proving that ln 4 is a tight upper and lower bound on the asymptotic 
discrepancy for all large k and by providing tight upper and lower 
bounds (in the form of provably optimal checkpointing algorithms, some 
of which are in fact better than those of Bringmann et al.) for all 
the small values of k â¤ 10.In the last part of the article, we

and scalable access to distributed computing capabilities and enable 
seamless resource sharing between users and platforms. This 
heterogeneous distribution of resources and the various modes of 
collaborations that exist between users, virtual organizations, and 
resource providers require scalable, flexible, and fine-grained access 
control to protect both individual and shared computing resources. In 
this article we propose a usage control (UCON) based security 
framework for collaborative applications, by following a layered 
approach with policy, enforcement, and implementation models, called 
the PEI framework. In the policy model layer, UCON policies are 
specified with predicates on subject and object attributes, along with 
system attributes as conditional constraints and user actions as 
obligations. General attributes include not only persistent attributes 
such as role and group memberships but also mutable usage attributes 
of subjects and objects. Conditions in UCON can be used to support 
context-based authorizations in ad hoc collaborations. In the 
enforcement model layer, our novel framework uses a hybrid approach 
for subject attribute acquisition with both push and pull modes. By 
leveraging attribute propagations between a centralized attribute 
repository and distributed policy decision points, our architecture 
supports decision continuity and attribute mutability of the UCON 
policy model, as well as obligation evaluations during policy 
enforcement. As a proof-of-concept, we implement a prototype system 
based on our proposed architecture and conduct experimental studies to 
demonstrate the feasibility and performance of our approach.},

This systematic review was conducted in 2018. Through this systematic 
review, international electronic databases were investigated for the 
research studies published in English. The exclusion and inclusion 
criteria were determined to extract the hospital resilience 
indicators. These indicators will be used in order to develop a model

analyzed to collect the indicators related to hospital disaster 
resilience (HDR). The domains and the indicators were extracted from 
these selected research studies. The authors collected and categorized 
them into three domains and twenty seven subdomains. The three domains 
included constructive, infrastructural, and administrative resilience. 
The relevant indicators were designed for each subdomain to assess 
HDR. Conclusion Since diverse indicators affect hospital resilience, 
other studies should be conducted to propose some models or tools to 
quantify the hospital resilience in different countries and scopes

  abstract = {Digital communication has revolutionized the way 
children interact and maintain social relations. However, not every 
tween (8-12 years) or teen (13-18 years) is able to take full 
advantage of digital media and may cross personal and social 
boundaries causing distress, mostly to their own friends at school and 
beyond. This results in adverse health effects for both the 
cyberbullying perpetrator and the victim. Articles reviewed on 
elementary school children and adolescents, collected from two 
different databases, showed that the number of elementary school kids 
using smartphones has more than doubled in the past few years. Given 
this rise, the risk of cyberbullying has also increased. Not all 
elementary school kids have the required media literacy to understand 
that their friends have equal rights in the virtual world as they do 
in the schoolyard. Regardless, they still carry a smartphone with 
data, use computers, and other electronic media to bully, embarrass, 
exclude, or humiliate others, often through social networking sites. 
Moving from tweens to teens seems to worsen the cyberbully behavior 
and choices, with middle school kids facing the highest cyberbullying 
incidents followed by high school kids and then the elementary school 
kids. The anonymity of cyberspace and the perceived lack of 
consequences seems to embolden the cyberbully. Identifying the mindset 
of a cyberbully and those at high risk of becoming a cyberbully can

boundaries that hinder the implementation of reverse logistics. Some 
of these obstacles include additional costs, the desire for deep 
collaboration with suppliers and customers, and the belief of some 
managers that are managing reverse flow that it is not worth the

    abstract = {Whereas a lot of efforts have been put on energy 
conservation in wireless sensor networks (WSNs), the limited lifetime 
of these systems still hampers their practical deployments. This 
situation is further exacerbated indoors, as conventional energy 
harvesting (e.g., solar) may not always work. To enable long-lived 
indoor sensing, we report in this article a self-sustaining sensing 
system that draws energy from indoor environments, adapts its 
duty-cycle to the harvested energy, and pays back the environment by 
enhancing the awareness of the indoor microclimate through an 
``energy-free'' sensing. First of all, given the pervasive operation 
of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems indoors, 
our system harvests energy from airflow introduced by the HVAC systems 
to power each sensor node. Secondly, as the harvested power is tiny, 
an extremely low but synchronous duty-cycle has to be applied whereas 
the system gets no energy surplus to support existing synchronization 
schemes. So, we design two complementary synchronization schemes that 
cost virtually no energy. Finally, we exploit the feature of our 
harvester to sense the airflow speed in an energy-free manner. To our 
knowledge, this is the first indoor wireless sensing system that 
encapsulates energy harvesting, network operating, and sensing all 
together.},

    abstract = {Embedded computing devices play an integral role in 
the mechanical operations of modern-day vehicles. These devices 
exchange information containing critical vehicle parameters that 
reflect the current state of operations. Such information can be 
captured for various purposes, such as diagnostics, fleet management,

for some applications, monitoring distinct combinations of parameters 
can reveal more complex and higher-level states that may give useful 
information. Existing monitoring systems either lack user 
configurability and control or present simple user interfaces that 
make it difficult to monitor and collate different parameters to 
observe high-level vehicle states. In this work, we present TruckSTM, 
a novel application that realizes user-defined states from messages 
seen in the embedded networks of medium and heavy duty vehicles and 
displays state transitions on an interactive user interface. We begin 
by symbolically formulating some of the in-vehicle networking concepts 
and formally defining the concept of operational states and state 
transitions. We then elaborate on the operations performed by TruckSTM 
in mapping network-obtained vehicle parameters to states that can be 
defined in standard JSON format. Finally, we evaluate TruckSTM{\rq}s 
asymptotic performance and present the results for the worst-case

been widely deployed in recent ARM processors for real-time debugging 
and tracing of software. Using PTM, the external debugger can extract 
execution behaviors of applications running on an ARM processor. 
Recently, some researchers have been using this feature for other 
purposes, such as fault-tolerant computation and security monitoring. 
This motivated us to develop an external security monitor that can 
detect control hijacking attacks, of which the goal is to maliciously 
manipulate the control flow of victim applications at an 
attacker{\rq}s disposal. This article focuses on detecting a special 
type of attack called code reuse attacks (CRA), which use a recently 
introduced technique that allows attackers to perform arbitrary 
computation without injecting their code by reusing only existing code 
fragments. Our external monitor is attached to the outside of the host 
system via the system bus and ARM CoreSight PTM, and is fed with 
execution traces of a victim application running on the host. As a 
majority of CRAs violates the normal execution behaviors of a program, 
our monitor constantly watches and analyzes the execution traces of 
the victim application and detects a symptom of attacks when the 
execution behaviors violate certain rules that normal applications are 
known to adhere. We present two different implementations for this 
purpose: a hardware-based solution in which all CRA detection 
components are implemented in hardware, and a hardware/software mixed 
solution that can be employed in a more resource-constrained 
environment where the deployment of full hardware-level CRA detection 
is burdensome.},

image processing raises a surprising host of legal and ethical 
questions that we must address. What are the ramifications of hiding

practice when used legitimately, or intentional deception? Is 
tampering with an image appropriate in cases where the image might 
affect public behavior? Does an image represent a crime, or is it 
simply a representation of a scene that has never existed? Before 
action can even be taken on the basis of a questionable image, we must 
detect something about the image itself. Investigators from a diverse

identification, we seek to identify the particular model of a camera,

is to establish the authenticity of an image, or to expose any 
potential tampering the image might have undergone. With steganalysis, 
the detection of hidden data within an image is performed, with a 
possible attempt to recover any detected data. Each of these

Flow Driven Sensor Networks for leakage and contamination monitoring

that the sensor network can be deployed in the underground water 
network with only access to connection points (through manholes) and 
driven only by water harvested energy without the need for AC power or 
frequent battery changes. Although water systems may be affected by a 
large variety of contaminants, only a few sensors can be practically

addressed are (a) adaptation of the network to the available energy to 
maximize leak/contamination detection and (b) minimal artificial water 
circulation or leakage to improve detectability during periods of 
almost zero natural water flow. The article shows, through extensive 
simulations, that the proposed approach can drastically reduce the

@article{10.1145/3324997,
    abstract = {Offensive or antagonistic language targeted at 
individuals and social groups based on their personal characteristics 
(also known as cyber hate speech or cyberhate) has been frequently 
posted and widely circulated via the World Wide Web. This can be 
considered as a key risk factor for individual and societal tension 
surrounding regional instability. Automated Web-based cyberhate 
detection is important for observing and understanding community and 
regional societal tension---especially in online social networks where 
posts can be rapidly and widely viewed and disseminated. While 
previous work has involved using lexicons, bags-of-words, or 
probabilistic language parsing approaches, they often suffer from a 
similar issue, which is that cyberhate can be subtle and 
indirect---thus, depending on the occurrence of individual words or 
phrases, can lead to a significant number of false negatives, 
providing inaccurate representation of the trends in cyberhate. This 
problem motivated us to challenge thinking around the representation 
of subtle language use, such as references to perceived threats from 
``the other'' including immigration or job prosperity in a hateful 
context. We propose a novel ``othering'' feature set that utilizes 
language use around the concept of ``othering'' and intergroup threat 
theory to identify these subtleties, and we implement a wide range of 
classification methods using embedding learning to compute semantic 
distances between parts of speech considered to be part of an 
``othering'' narrative. To validate our approach, we conducted two 
sets of experiments. The first involved comparing the results of our 
novel method with state-of-the-art baseline models from the 
literature. Our approach outperformed all existing methods. The second 
tested the best performing models from the first phase on unseen 
datasets for different types of cyberhate, namely religion, 
disability, race, and sexual orientation. The results showed F-measure 
scores for classifying hateful instances obtained through applying our 
model of 0.81, 0.71, 0.89, and 0.72, respectively, demonstrating the 
ability of the ``othering'' narrative to be an important part of model

@article{10.1145/3027489,
    abstract = {Fine-grained real-time metering is a fundamental 
service of wireless energy auditing networks, where metering data is 
transmitted from embedded wireless power meters to gateways for 
centralized processing, storage, and forwarding. Due to limited meter 
capability and wireless bandwidth, the increasing sampling rates and 
network scales needed to support new energy auditing applications pose 
significant challenges to metering data fidelity and secrecy. This 
article exploits the compression and encryption properties of 
compressive sensing (CS) to design a joint data compression and 
encryption (JICE) approach that addresses these two challenges 
simultaneously. Compared with a conventional signal processing 
pipeline that compresses and encrypts data sequentially, JICE reduces 
computation and space complexities due to its simple design. It thus 
leaves more processor time and available buffer space for handling 
lossy wireless transmissions. Moreover, JICE features an adaptive 
reconfiguration mechanism that selects the signal representation basis 
of CS at runtime among several candidate bases to achieve the best 
fidelity of the recovered data at the gateways. This mechanism enables 
JICE to adapt to changing power consumption patterns. On a smart plug 
platform, we implemented JICE and several baseline approaches 
including downsampling, lossless compression, and the pipeline 
approach. Extensive testbed experiments show that JICE achieves higher 
data delivery ratios and lower recovery distortions under a range of 
realistic settings. In particular, at a meter sampling rate of 8 Hz, 
JICE increases the number of meters supported by a gateway by 50\%, 
compared with the commonly used pipeline approach, while keeping a 
signal distortion rate lower than 5\%.},

    abstract = {Building a micro-solar power system is challenging 
because it must address long-term system behavior under highly 
variable solar energy and consider a large design space. We develop a 
practical theory of micro-solar power systems that is materialized in 
a simulation suite that models component and system behavior over a 
long time scale and in an external environment that depends on time, 
location, weather, and local variations. This simulation provides 
sufficient accuracy to guide specific design choices in a large design 
space. Unlike the many macro-solar calculators, this design tool 
models detailed behavior of milliwatt systems in the worst conditions, 
rather than typical behavior of kilowatt systems in the best 
conditions. Our simulation suite is validated with a concrete design 
of micro-solar power systems, the HydroWatch node. With our simulation 
suite, micro-solar power systems can be designed in a systematic 
fashion. Putting the model and empirical vehicle together, the design 
choices in each component of a micro-solar power system are studied to 
reach a deployable candidate. The deployment is evaluated by analyzing 
the effects of different solar profiles across the network. The 
analysis from the deployment can be used to refine the next 
system-design iteration.},

    abstract = {Information centric networking ICN has been regarded 
as an ideal architecture for the next-generation network to handle 
users{\rq} increasing demand for content delivery with in-network 
cache. While making better use of network resources and providing 
better service delivery, an effective access control mechanism is 
needed due to the widely disseminated contents. However, in the 
existing solutions, making cache-enabled routers or content providers 
authenticate users{\rq} requests causes high computation overhead and 
unnecessary delay. Also, the straightforward utilization of advanced 
encryption algorithms makes the system vulnerable to DoS attacks. 
Besides, privacy protection and service accountability are rarely 
taken into account in this scenario. In this paper, we propose SEAF, a 
secure, efficient, and accountable edge-based access control framework 
for ICN, in which authentication is performed at the network edge to 
block unauthorized requests at the very beginning. We adopt group 
signature to achieve anonymous authentication and use hash chain 
technique to reduce greatly the overhead when users make continuous 
requests for the same file. At the same time, we provide an efficient 
revocation method to make our framework more robust. Furthermore, the 
content providers can affirm the service amount received from the 
network and extract feedback information from the signatures and hash 
chains. By formal security analysis and the comparison with related 
works, we show that SEAF achieves the expected security goals and 
possesses more useful features. The experimental results also 
demonstrate that our design is efficient for routers and content 
providers and bring in only slight delay for users{\rq} content 
retrieval.},

    abstract = {Many Internet of Things and embedded projects are 
event driven, and therefore require asynchronous and concurrent 
programming. Current proposals for C++20 suggest that coroutines will 
have native language support. It is timely to survey the current use 
of coroutines in embedded systems development. This article 
investigates existing research which uses or describes coroutines on 
resource-constrained platforms. The existing research is analysed with 
regard to: software platform, hardware platform, and capacity; use 
cases and intended benefits; and the application programming interface 
design used for coroutines. A systematic mapping study was performed, 
to select studies published between 2007 and 2018 which contained 
original research into the application of coroutines on 
resource-constrained platforms. An initial set of 566 candidate 
papers, collated from on-line databases, were reduced to only 35 after 
filters were applied, revealing the following taxonomy. The C 8 C++ 
programming languages were used by 22 studies out of 35. As regards 
hardware, 16 studies used 8- or 16-bit processors while 13 used 32-bit 
processors. The four most common use cases were concurrency (17 
papers), network communication (15), sensor readings (9), and data 
flow (7). The leading intended benefits were code style and simplicity 
(12 papers), scheduling (9), and efficiency (8). A wide variety of 
techniques have been used to implement coroutines, including native 
macros, additional tool chain steps, new language features, and 
non-portable assembly language. We conclude that there is widespread 
demand for coroutines on resource-constrained devices. Our findings 
suggest that there is significant demand for a formalised, stable, 
well-supported implementation of coroutines in C++, designed with 
consideration of the special needs of resource-constrained devices, 
and further that such an implementation would bring benefits specific 
to such devices.},

    abstract = {Multi- and many-core processors are becoming 
increasingly popular in embedded systems. Many of these processors now 
feature hardware virtualization capabilities, as found on the ARM 
Cortex A15 and x86 architectures with Intel VT-x or AMD-V support. 
Hardware virtualization provides a way to partition physical 
resources, including processor cores, memory, and I/O devices, among 
guest virtual machines (VMs). Each VM is then able to host tasks of a 
specific criticality level, as part of a mixed-criticality system with 
different timing and safety requirements. However, traditional virtual 
machine systems are inappropriate for mixed-criticality computing. 
They use hypervisors to schedule separate VMs on physical processor 
cores. The costs of trapping into hypervisors to multiplex and manage 
machine physical resources on behalf of separate guests are too 
expensive for many time-critical tasks. Additionally, traditional 
hypervisors have memory footprints that are often too large for many 
embedded computing systems. In this article, we discuss the design of 
the Quest-V separation kernel, which partitions services of different 
criticality levels across separate VMs, or sandboxes. Each sandbox 
encapsulates a subset of machine physical resources that it manages 
without requiring intervention from a hypervisor. In Quest-V, a 
hypervisor is only needed to bootstrap the system, recover from 
certain faults, and establish communication channels between 
sandboxes. This not only reduces the memory footprint of the most 
privileged protection domain but also removes it from the control path 
during normal system operation, thereby heightening security.},

specifically, we show that small (on average 0.5\% modified area),

a layout can nonetheless trick a CNN-based hotspot detector into 
predicting the modified layout as hotspot free (with up to 99.7\% 
success in finding perturbations that flip a detector{\rq}s output

    abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm combines the 
interconnection of massive amounts of battery-constrained and 
low-computational-power devices with low-latency and high-reliability 
network requirements. Additionally, diverse end-to-end services and 
applications with different Quality of Service (QoS) requirements are 
expected to coexist in the same network infrastructure. 
Software-defined Networking (SDN) is a paradigm designed to solve 
these problems, but its implementation in wireless networks and 
especially in the resource-constrained IoT systems is extremely 
challenging and has seen very limited adoption, since it requires 
isolation of data and control plane information flows and a reliable 
and scalable control plane. In this work, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) 
mesh is introduced as an adequate technology for an all-wireless 
SDN-BLE implementation, which is a technology that has become the 
de-facto standard for IoT. The proposed SDN-BLE framework uses a 
routing network slice for the data plane information flow and a 
flooding network slice for the control plane information flow, 
ensuring their isolation while still being transmitted over the 
wireless medium. The design and implementation of all the classical 
SDN layers on a hybrid BLE mesh testbed is given, where the data plane 
is formed by the BLE nodes and the control plane can be centralized on 
a server or distributed over several WiFi gateways. Several 
controllers are described and implemented, allowing the framework to 
obtain end-to-end network knowledge to manage individual nodes over 
the air and configure their behavior to meet application requirements. 
An experimental characterization of the SDN-BLE framework is given, 
where the impact of the different parameters of the system on the 
network reliability, overhead, and energy consumption is studied. 
Additionally, the distributed versus centralized control plane 
operation modes are experimentally characterized, and it is shown that 
the distributed approach can provide the same performance as the 
centralized one when careful system design is performed. Finally, a 
proof of concept for the SDN-BLE framework is presented, where a 
network congestion is automatically detected and the nodes responsible 
of such congestion are identified and reconfigured over the air, 
bypassing the congested links, to resume regular network 
performance.},

to an organization. Unfortunately, they are very difficult to foresee, 
detect, and defend against due to the trust and responsibilities 
placed on the employees. In this article, we first define the notion 
of user intent and construct a model for a common scenario that poses 
a very high risk for sensitive data stored in the organization{\rq}s 
database. We show that the complexity of identifying pseudo-intents of 
a user in this scenario is coNP-Complete, and launching a harvester 
insider attack within the boundaries of the defined threat model takes 
linear time while a targeted threat model is an NP-Complete problem. 
We also discuss the general defense mechanisms against the modeled 
threats and show that countering the harvester insider attack takes 
quadratic time while countering the targeted insider attack can take 
linear to quadratic time, depending on the strategy chosen. We analyze 
the adversarial behavior and show that launching an attack with 
minimum risk is also an NP-Complete problem. Finally, we perform 
timing experiments with the defense mechanisms on SQL query workloads 
collected from a national bank to test the feasibility of using these 
systems in real time.},

    abstract = {Access management of IoT devices is extremely 
important, and a secure login authentication scheme can effectively 
protect users{\rq} privacy. However, traditional authentication 
schemes are threatened by shoulder-surfing attacks, and 
biometric-based schemes, such as fingerprint recognition and face 
recognition, that are commonly used today can also be cracked. 
Researchers have proposed some schemes for current attacks, but they 
are limited by usability. For example, the login authentication 
process requires additional device support. This method solves the 
problem of attacks, but it is unusable, which limits its application. 
At present, most authentication schemes for the Internet of Things and 
mobile platforms either focus on security, thus ignoring availability, 
or have excellent convenience but insufficient security. This is a 
symmetry problem worth exploring. Therefore, users need a new type of 
login authentication scheme that can balance security and usability to 
protect users{\rq} private data or maintain device security. In this 
paper, we propose a login authentication scheme named PinWheel, which 
combines a textual password, a graphical password, and biometrics to 
prevent both shoulder-surfing attacks and smudge attacks and solves 
the current schemes{\rq} lack of usability. We implemented PinWheel 
and evaluated it from the perspective of security and usability. The 
experiments required 262 days, and 573 subjects participated in our 
investigation. The evaluation results show that PinWheel can at least 
effectively resist both mainstream attacks and is superior to most 
existing schemes in terms of usability.},

    abstract = {With the fast growth of civil drones, their security 
problems meet significant challenges. A commercial drone may be 
hijacked by a GPS-spoofing attack for illegal activities, such as 
terrorist attacks. The target of this article is to develop a 
technique that only uses onboard gyroscopes to determine whether a 
drone has been hijacked.Ideally, GPS data and the angular velocities 
measured by gyroscopes can be used to estimate the acceleration of a 
drone, which can be further compared with the measurement of the 
accelerometer to detect whether a drone has been hijacked. However, 
the detection results may not always be accurate due to some 
calculation and measurement errors, especially when no hijacking 
occurs in curve trajectory situations. To overcome this, in this 
article, we propose a novel and simple method to detect hijacking only 
based on gyroscopes{\rq} measurements and GPS data, without using any 
accelerometer in the detection procedure. The computational complexity 
of our method is very low, which is suitable to be implemented in the 
drones with micro-controllers. On the other hand, the proposed method 
does not rely on any accelerometer to detect attacks, which means it 
receives less information in the detection procedure and may reduce 
the results accuracy in some special situations. While the previous 
method can compensate for this flaw, the high detection results also 
can be guaranteed by using the above two methods. Experiments with a 
quad-rotor drone are conducted to show the effectiveness of the 
proposed method and the combination method.},

    abstract = {Self-adaptive systems must decide which adaptations to 
apply and when. In reactive approaches, adaptations are chosen and 
executed after some issue in the system has been detected (e.g., 
unforeseen attacks or failures). In proactive approaches, predictions 
are used to prepare the system for some future event (e.g., traffic 
spikes during holidays). In both cases, the choice of adaptation is 
based on the estimated impact it will have on the system. Current 
decision-making approaches assume that the impact will be 
instantaneous, whereas it is common that adaptations take time to 
produce their impact. Ignoring this latency is problematic because 
adaptations may not achieve their effect in time for a predicted 
event. Furthermore, lower impact but quicker adaptations may be 
ignored altogether, even if over time the accrued impact is actually 
higher. In this article, we introduce a novel approach to choosing 
adaptations that considers these latencies. To show how this improves 
adaptation decisions, we use a two-pronged approach: (i) model 
checking of Stochastic Multiplayer Games (SMGs) enables us to 
understand best- and worst-case scenarios of optimal latency-aware and 
non-latency-aware adaptation without the need to develop specific 
adaptation algorithms. However, since SMGs do not provide an algorithm 
to make choices at runtime, we propose a (ii) latency-aware adaptation 
algorithm to make decisions at runtime. Simulations are used to 
explore more detailed adaptation behavior and to check if the 
performance of the algorithm falls within the bounds predicted by 
SMGs. Our results show that latency awareness improves adaptation 
outcomes and also allows a larger set of adaptations to be 
exploited.},

Cyber Physical System (CPS) application for human--computer 
interaction. In the process of vehicle driving, we use the information 
from CPS on ADAS to not only help us understand the driving condition 
of the car but also help us change the driving strategies to drive in 
a better and safer way. After getting the information, the driver can 
evaluate the feedback information of the vehicle, so as to enhance the 
ability to assist in driving of the ADAS system. This completes a 
complete human--computer interaction process. However, the data 
obtained during the interaction usually form a large dimension, and 
irrelevant features sometimes hide the occurrence of anomalies, which 
poses a significant challenge to us to better understand the driving 
states of the car.To solve this problem, we propose an anomaly 
detection framework based on RBM-LSTM. In this hybrid framework, RBM 
is trained to extract general underlying features from data collected 
by CPS, and LSTM is trained from the features learned by RBM. This 
framework can effectively improve the prediction speed and present a 
good prediction accuracy to show vehicle driving condition. Besides, 
drivers are allowed to evaluate the prediction results, so as to 
improve the accuracy of prediction. Through the experimental results, 
we can find that the proposed framework not only simplifies the 
training of the entire neural network and increases the training speed 
but also greatly improves the accuracy of the interaction-driven data 
analysis. It is a valid method to analyze the data generated during

into different categories based on the underlying approach adopted by

features to traditional broadcast television, the Digital Video 
Broadcasting (DVB) consortium introduced a specification called Hybrid 
Broadcast-Broadband Television (HbbTV), which allows broadcast streams 
to include embedded HTML content that is rendered by the television. 
This system is already in very wide deployment in Europe and has 
recently been adopted as part of the American digital television 
standard. Our analyses of the specifications, and of real systems 
implementing them, show that the broadband and broadcast systems are 
combined insecurely. This enables a large-scale exploitation technique 
with a localized geographical footprint based on Radio Frequency (RF) 
injection, which requires a minimal budget and infrastructure and is 
remarkably difficult to detect. In this article, we present the attack 
methodology and a number of follow-on exploitation techniques that 
provide significant flexibility to attackers. Furthermore, we 
demonstrate that the technical complexity and required budget are low, 
making this attack practical and realistic, especially in areas with 
high population density: In a dense urban area, an attacker with a 
budget of about 450 can target more than 20,000 devices in a single 
attack. A unique aspect of this attack is that, in contrast to most

authentication for naming, routing, and end-entity (EE) certification 
to a global environment in which authentication policies and 
users{\rq} sets of trust roots vary widely. The current mechanisms for 
authenticating names (DNSSEC), routes (BGPSEC), and EE certificates

make flexible trust decisions. We propose the Scalable Authentication 
Infrastructure for Next-generation Trust (SAINT), which partitions the 
Internet into groups with common, local trust roots and isolates the 
effects of a compromised trust root. SAINT requires groups with direct 
routing connections to cross-sign each other for authentication 
purposes, allowing diverse authentication policies while keeping all 
entities{\rq} authentication information globally discoverable. SAINT 
makes trust root management a central part of the network 
architecture, enabling trust root updates within seconds and allowing 
users to make flexible trust decisions. SAINT operates without a 
significant performance penalty and can be deployed alongside existing 
infrastructures.},

@article{10.1145/3371151,
    abstract = {Code-reuse attack is a concrete threat to computing 
systems because it can evade conventional security defenses. Control 
flow integrity (CFI) is proposed to repel this threat. However, former 
implementations of CFI suffer from two major drawbacks: complex 
offline processing on programs and high overheads at runtime. 
Therefore, it is impractical for performance-constrained devices to 
adopt the technology, leaving them vulnerable to exploitation.In this 
article, we develop a cross-layer approach named 
basic-block-boundary-based control flow integrity (BBB-CFI) to 
minimize the overheads of both offline analysis and runtime checking. 
Our approach employs basic block information inside the binary code 
and read-only data to enforce CFI. We identify a key binary-level 
property called basic block boundary, and based on it we propose the 
code-inspired method where short code sequences can endorse a control 
flow transition. Our solution enables quick application launching 
because it does not require control flow graph construction at the 
offline stage. We only demand a lightweight analysis on read-only data 
and a small amount of code of the application. According to the 
experiments, our approach incurs a negligible 0.11\% runtime 
performance overhead with a minor processor extension, whereas it 
achieves an order of magnitude speedup in pre-preprocessing compared 
to a baseline approach. Without control flow analysis or 
recompilation, BBB-CFI still effectively reduces 90\% of the attack 
surface in terms of gadget numbers. Besides this, we show that the 
Turing-completeness in the libc is unsustainable. Our approach also 
demonstrates high applicability to many programs, and it is capable of 
protecting striped binaries.},

    abstract = {In this paper, we present a new record linkage 
approach that uses entity behavior to decide if potentially different 
entities are in fact the same. An entity's behavior is extracted from 
a transaction log that records the actions of this entity with respect

merges the behavior of two possible matched entities and computes the 
gain in recognizing behavior patterns as their matching score. The 
idea is that if we obtain a well recognized behavior after merge, then 
most likely, the original two behaviors belong to the same entity as 
the behavior becomes more complete after the merge. We present the 
necessary algorithms to model entities' behavior and compute a 
matching score for them. To improve the computational efficiency of

    abstract = {The past few years have witnessed a rapid growth of 
stationless bike sharing services. The service allows the bikes to be 
dropped off freely and to be found through GPS localization. In 
practice, the bikes are often parked in close proximity to buildings, 
where GPS accuracy suffers, making bike search a challenging task. 
This article proposes a novel approach to addressing this problem. 
Inspired by multi-antenna systems, our method tries to collect GPS 
signals from multiple distributed bikes, by organizing a group of 
bikes into a network, called a BikeGPS network. Formed by pedestrian 
users who opportunistically measure inter-bike distance via radio 
sensing and step tracking, the generated network permits one to map 
all the nodes{\rq} satellite range measurements into a single lead 
node{\rq}s view. By considering both signal and geometry properties of 
satellite raw measurements, and using an asynchronous coarse time 
navigation algorithm, the lead node can accurately derive the 
locations of all the network nodes. Experiments in real-world 
scenarios show that BikeGPS significantly improves the localization 
performance, in terms of both accuracy and solution availability, 
compared with the naive GPS approach and a high-level cooperative 
localization method.},

their function, for a variety of scenarios. Then, we demonstrated the

Directed Greybox Fuzzing (DGF) approaches were recently proposed. 
Current DGFs are powerful and efficient approaches that can compete

    abstract = {With the increasing availability of LCD displays and 
phone cameras in today's environment, screen-camera communication 
using dynamic barcode has emerged as a convenient infrastructure-free 
form to establish impromptu communication channel among mobile 
devices. Due to the short wavelengths and narrow beams of visible 
light, screen-camera communication is highly directional, 
low-interference and secure, which envisions a wide range of 
application scenarios. Conventional screen-camera communication 
systems encode data bits with color in dynamic barcodes, which suffers 
from the frame mixture problem caused by the rolling shutter effect of 
CMOS camera in high capturing rate. In this paper, we propose a novel 
design of dynamic barcode called ShiftCode that encodes data bits with 
shifting shape patterns, which provide a new way to expand the barcode 
capacity for screen-camera communications. ShiftCode adopts a 
pattern-based layout design to embed multiple data bits in a symbol 
representation. With such layout, it exploits a decoding mechanism to 
solve the frame mixture problem and achieves high frame capturing 
rate. It further intruduces a two-level reliability technique for 
intra-frame error correction and inter-frame redundancy, which reduces

    abstract = {VM migration is an effective countermeasure against 
attempts at malicious co-residency. In this paper, our overarching 
objectives are: a to get an in-depth understanding of the ways and 
effectiveness with which an attacker can launch attacks toward 
achieving co-residency and b to design migration policies that are 
very effective in thwarting malicious co-residency, but are thrifty in 
terms of the bandwidth and downtime costs that are incurred with live 
migration. Toward achieving our goals, we first undertake an 
experimental study on Amazon EC2 to obtain an in-depth understanding 
of the side-channels, through which an attacker can use to ascertain 
co-residency with a victim. Here, in this paper, we identify a new set 
of stealthy side-channel attacks which we show to be more effective 
than the currently available attacks toward verifying co-residency. We 
also build a simple model that can be used for estimating co-residency 
times based on very few measurements on a given cloud platform, to 
account for varying attacker capabilities. Based on the study, we 
develop a set of guidelines to determine under what conditions the 
victim VM migrations should be triggered, given the performance costs 
in terms of bandwidth and downtime, which a user is willing to bear. 
Through extensive experiments on our private in-house cloud, we show 
that the migrations, using our guidelines, can limit the fraction of 
the time that an attacker VM co-resides with a victim VM to about 1\% 
of the time with the bandwidth costs of a few MB and downtimes of a 
few seconds per day per VM migrated.},

    abstract = {As the Industry 4.0 or Internet of Things (IoT) era 
begins, security plays a key role in the Industry Internet of Things 
(IIoT) due to various threats, which include escape or Distributed 
Denial of Service (DDoS) attackers in the virtualization layer and 
vulnerability exploiters in the device layer. A successful cross-VM 
escape attack in the virtualization layer combined with cross-layer 
penetration in the device layer, which we define as an Advanced 
Persistent Escaper (APE), poses a great threat. Therefore, the 
development of detection and rejection methods for APEs across 
multiple layers in IIoT is an open issue. To the best of our 
knowledge, less effective methods are established, especially for 
vulnerability exploitation in the virtualization layer and backdoor 
leverage in the device layer. On the basis of this, we propose Escaper 
Cops (EscaperCOP), a detection method for cross-VM escapers in the 
virtualization layer and cross-layer penetrators in the device layer. 
In particular, a new detection method for guest-to-host escapers is 
proposed for the virtualization layer. Finally, a novel encryption 
method based on Identity-based Broadcast Encryption (IBBE) is proposed 
to protect the critical components in EscaperCOP, detection library, 
and control command library. To verify our method, experimental tests 
are performed for a large number of APEs in an IIoT framework. The 
test results have demonstrated the proposed method is effective with 
an acceptable level of detection ratio.},

    abstract = {Mobile sensing is a promising sensing paradigm in the 
era of Internet of Things IoT that utilizes mobile device sensors to 
collect sensory data about sensing targets and further applies 
learning techniques to recognize the sensed targets to correct classes 
or categories. Due to the recent great success of deep learning, an 
emerging trend is to adopt deep learning in this recognition process, 
while we find an overlooked yet crucial issue to be solved in this 
paper --- The size of deep learning models should be sufficiently 
large for reliably classifying various types of recognition targets, 
while the achieved processing delay may fail to satisfy the stringent 
latency requirement from applications. If we blindly shrink the deep 
learning model for acceleration, the performance cannot be guaranteed. 
To cope with this challenge, this paper presents a compact deep neural 
network architecture, namely cDeepArch. The key idea of the cDeepArch 
design is to decompose the entire recognition task into two 
lightweight sub-problems: context recognition and the context-oriented 
target recognitions. This decomposition essentially utilizes the 
adequate storage to trade for the CPU and memory resource consumptions 
during execution. In addition, we further formulate the execution 
latency for decomposed deep learning models and propose a set of 
enhancement techniques, so that system performance and resource 
consumption can be quantitatively balanced. We implement a cDeepArch 
prototype system and conduct extensive experiments. The result shows 
that cDeepArch achieves excellent recognition performance and the 
execution latency is also lightweight.},

@article{10.1145/2019618.2019622,
    abstract = {Data stream classification for intrusion detection 
poses at least three major challenges. First, these data streams are 
typically infinite-length, making traditional multipass learning 
algorithms inapplicable. Second, they exhibit significant 
concept-drift as attackers react and adapt to defenses. Third, for 
data streams that do not have any fixed feature set, such as text 
streams, an additional feature extraction and selection task must be 
performed. If the number of candidate features is too large, then 
traditional feature extraction techniques fail.In order to address the 
first two challenges, this article proposes a multipartition, 
multichunk ensemble classifier in which a collection of v classifiers 
is trained from r consecutive data chunks using v-fold partitioning of 
the data, yielding an ensemble of such classifiers. This 
multipartition, multichunk ensemble technique significantly reduces 
classification error compared to existing single-partition, 
single-chunk ensemble approaches, wherein a single data chunk is used 
to train each classifier. To address the third challenge, a feature 
extraction and selection technique is proposed for data streams that 
do not have any fixed feature set. The technique's scalability is 
demonstrated through an implementation for the Hadoop MapReduce cloud 
computing architecture. Both theoretical and empirical evidence 
demonstrate its effectiveness over other state-of-the-art stream 
classification techniques on synthetic data, real botnet traffic, and 
malicious executables.},

@article{10.1145/2362394.2362400,
    abstract = {Cyberbullying (harassment on social networks) is 
widely recognized as a serious social problem, especially for 
adolescents. It is as much a threat to the viability of online social 
networks for youth today as spam once was to email in the early days 
of the Internet. Current work to tackle this problem has involved 
social and psychological studies on its prevalence as well as its 
negative effects on adolescents. While true solutions rest on teaching 
youth to have healthy personal relationships, few have considered 
innovative design of social network software as a tool for mitigating 
this problem. Mitigating cyberbullying involves two key components: 
robust techniques for effective detection and reflective user 
interfaces that encourage users to reflect upon their behavior and 
their choices.Spam filters have been successful by applying 
statistical approaches like Bayesian networks and hidden Markov 
models. They can, like Google{\rq}s GMail, aggregate human spam 
judgments because spam is sent nearly identically to many people. 
Bullying is more personalized, varied, and contextual. In this work, 
we present an approach for bullying detection based on 
state-of-the-art natural language processing and a common sense 
knowledge base, which permits recognition over a broad spectrum of 
topics in everyday life. We analyze a more narrow range of particular 
subject matter associated with bullying (e.g. appearance, 
intelligence, racial and ethnic slurs, social acceptance, and 
rejection), and construct BullySpace, a common sense knowledge base 
that encodes particular knowledge about bullying situations. We then 
perform joint reasoning with common sense knowledge about a wide range 
of everyday life topics. We analyze messages using our novel 
AnalogySpace common sense reasoning technique. We also take into 
account social network analysis and other factors. We evaluate the 
model on real-world instances that have been reported by users on 
Formspring, a social networking website that is popular with 
teenagers.On the intervention side, we explore a set of reflective 
user-interaction paradigms with the goal of promoting empathy among 
social network participants. We propose an ``air traffic 
control''-like dashboard, which alerts moderators to large-scale 
outbreaks that appear to be escalating or spreading and helps them 
prioritize the current deluge of user complaints. For potential 
victims, we provide educational material that informs them about how 
to cope with the situation, and connects them with emotional support 
from others. A user evaluation shows that in-context, targeted, and 
dynamic help during cyberbullying situations fosters end-user 
reflection that promotes better coping strategies.},

    abstract = {In cyber-physical systems, due to the tight 
integration of the computational, communication, and physical 
components, most of the information in the cyber-domain manifests in 
terms of physical actions (such as motion, temperature change, etc.). 
This leads to the system being prone to physical-to-cyber domain 
attacks that affect the confidentiality. Physical actions are governed 
by energy flows, which may be observed. Some of these observable 
energy flows unintentionally leak information about the cyber-domain 
and hence are known as the side-channels. Side-channels such as 
acoustic, thermal, and power allow attackers to acquire the 
information without actually leveraging the vulnerability of the 
algorithms implemented in the system. As a case study, we have taken 
cyber-physical additive manufacturing systems (fused deposition 
modeling-based three-dimensional (3D) printer) to demonstrate how the 
acoustic side-channel can be used to breach the confidentiality of the 
system. In 3D printers, geometry, process, and machine information are 
the intellectual properties, which are stored in the cyber domain 
(G-code). We have designed an attack model that consists of digital 
signal processing, machine-learning algorithms, and context-based post 
processing to steal the intellectual property in the form of geometry 
details by reconstructing the G-code and thus the test objects. We

popularity. Online shopping and in-app purchase from such headsets are 
presenting new e-commerce opportunities to the app developers. For 
convenience, users of these headsets may store account login, bank 
account and credit card details in order to perform quick in-app 
purchases. If the device is unattended, then an attacker, which can 
include insiders, can make use of the stored account and banking 
details to perform their own in-app purchases at the expense of the 
legitimate owner. To better protect the legitimate users of VR 
headsets (or head mounted displays in general) from such threats, in 
this paper, we propose to use eye movement to continuously 
authenticate the current wearer of the VR headset. We built a 
prototype device which allows us to apply visual stimuli to the wearer 
and to video the eye movements of the wearer at the same time. We use 
implicit visual stimuli (the contents of existing apps) which evoke 
eye movements from the headset wearer but without distracting them 
from their normal activities. This is so that we can continuously 
authenticate the wearer without them being aware of the authentication 
running in the background. We evaluated our proposed system 
experimentally with 30 subjects. Our results showed that the 
achievable authentication accuracy for implicit visual stimuli is 
comparable to that of using explicit visual stimuli. We also tested 
the time stability of our proposed method by collecting eye movement 
data on two different days that are two weeks apart. Our 
authentication method achieved an Equal Error Rate of 6.9\% (resp. 
9.7\%) if data collected from the same day (resp. two weeks apart) 
were used for testing. In addition, we considered active impersonation 
attacks where attackers trying to imitate legitimate users' eye 
movements. We found that for a simple (resp. complex) eye tracking 
scene, a successful attack could be realised after on average 5.67 
(13.50) attempts and our proposed authentication algorithm gave a 
false acceptance rate of 14.17\% (3.61\%). These results show that 
active impersonating attacks can be prevented using complex scenes and 
an appropriate limit on the number of authentication attempts. Lastly, 
we carried out a survey to study the user acceptability to our 
proposed implicit stimuli. We found that on a 5-point Likert scale, at 
least 60\% of the respondents either agreed or strongly agreed that 
our proposed implicit stimuli were non-intrusive.},

certificate involves three steps: (i) checking its expiration date, 
(ii) verifying its signature, and (iii) ensuring that it is not 
revoked. Currently, such certificate revocation checks (i.e., step 
(iii) above) are done either via Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs),

despite the existence of these revocation checks, sophisticated 
cyber-attackers can still trick web browsers to trust a revoked

    abstract = {The ability to measure privacy accurately and 
consistently is key in the development of new privacy protections. 
However, recent studies have uncovered weaknesses in existing privacy 
metrics, as well as weaknesses caused by the use of only a single 
privacy metric. Metrics suites, or combinations of privacy metrics, 
are a promising mechanism to alleviate these weaknesses, if we can 
solve two open problems: which metrics should be combined and how. In 
this article, we tackle the first problem, i.e., the selection of 
metrics for strong metrics suites, by formulating it as a knapsack 
optimization problem with both single and multiple objectives. Because 
solving this problem exactly is difficult due to the large number of 
combinations and many qualities/objectives that need to be evaluated 
for each metrics suite, we apply 16 existing evolutionary and 
metaheuristic optimization algorithms. We solve the optimization 
problem for three privacy application domains: genomic privacy, graph 
privacy, and vehicular communications privacy. We find that the 
resulting metrics suites have better properties, i.e., higher 
monotonicity, diversity, evenness, and shared value range, than 
previously proposed metrics suites.},

originator touches many others the targets. Motives for activity may 
be benign mailing lists, content-delivery networks, and research 
scanning, malicious spammers and scanners for security 
vulnerabilities, or perhaps indeterminate ad trackers. Knowledge of 
malicious activity may help anticipate attacks, and understanding 
benign activity may set a baseline or characterize growth. This paper 
identifies domain name system DNS backscatter as a new source of 
information about network-wide activity. Backscatter is the reverse 
DNS queries caused when targets or middleboxes automatically look up 
the domain name of the originator. Queries are visible to the 
authoritative DNS servers that handle reverse DNS. While the fraction 
of backscatter they see depends on the server's location in the DNS 
hierarchy, we show that activity that touches many targets appear even 
in sampled observations. We use information about the queriers to 
classify originator activity using machine-learning. Our algorithm has 
reasonable accuracy and precision 70-80\% as shown by data from three 
different organizations operating DNS servers at the root or country 
level. Using this technique, we examine nine months of activity from 
one authority to identify trends in scanning, identifying bursts

    abstract = {If the mantra ``data is the new oil'' of our digital 
economy is correct, then data leak incidents are the critical 
disasters in the online society. The initial goal of our research was 
to present a comprehensive database of data breaches of personal 
information that took place in 2018 and 2019. This information was to 
be drawn from press reports, industry studies, and reports from 
regulatory agencies across the world. This article identified the top 
430 largest data breach incidents among more than 10,000 data breach 
incidents.In the process, we encountered many complications, 
especially regarding the lack of standardization of reporting. This 
article should be especially interesting to the readers of JDIQ 
because it describes both the range of data quality and consistency 
issues found as well as what was learned from the database created.The 
database that was created, available at https://www.databreachdb.com, 
shows that the number of data records breached in those top 430 
incidents increased from around 4B in 2018 to more than 22B in 2019. 
This increase occurred despite the strong efforts from regulatory 
agencies across the world to enforce strict rules on data protection 
and privacy, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) 
that went into effect in Europe in May 2018. Such regulatory effort 
could explain the reason why there is such a large number of data 
breach cases reported in the European Union when compared to the U.S. 
(more than 10,000 data breaches publicly reported in the U.S. since 
2018, while the EU reported more than 160,0001 data breaches since May 
2018). However, we still face the problem of an excessive number of 
breach incidents around the world.This research helps to understand 
the challenges of proper visibility of such incidents on a global 
scale. The results of this research can help government entities, 
regulatory bodies, security and data quality researchers, companies, 
and managers to improve the data quality of data breach reporting and 
increase the visibility of the data breach landscape around the world 
in the future.},

groups. It is a multifaceted phenomenon so it is important that 
researchers consider family related variables in addition to 
developmental ones. The aim of this study was to investigate whether 
moral maturity and attachment to father are associated with specific 
types of bullying experiences. Six hundred and forty eight adolescents 
(M\,=\,15.86, SD\,=\,0.94) participated in the study. Participants 
were 9th--11th grade students. The questionnaire included demographic 
information, The Revised Olweus Bully/Victim Questionnaire and 
Inventory of Parent and Peer Attachment (Father Form-Short). 
Descriptives, frequencies, Chi-square Tests, Kruskal--Wallis Test, 
Spearman correlation, and Multinomial Regression Analysis were 
executed. Students categorized by their bullying experiences as 
follows: 40.5\% (n\,=\,256) were neither bully nor victim; 13.3\% 
(n\,=\,84) were only bully; 20.3\% (n\,=\,128) only victim and 25.9\% 
(n\,=\,164) were both bully and victim. Neither bully nor victim group 
had the highest rate of not witnessing to a violent act in a lifetime. 
And this group had better scores for attachment to father and moral 
maturity than the other bully groups. Age, gender, moral maturity and 
witnessing a violent crime emerged as predictors for belonging to 
bully experience groups. Different variables must be considered as 
predictors for several bullying groups. Results imply that being 
female is a vulnerability to be a victim and prevention programs must 
support students{\rq} moral maturity. Also, screening the students for 
possible past traumatic experiences and providing psychological help 
to traumatized ones are other important implications.},

integrated channel networks are becoming increasingly prevalent in 
research in the biological sciences. At present, these devices are 
physically laid out by hand by domain experts who understand both the 
underlying technology and the biological functions that will execute 
on fabricated devices. The lack of a design science that is specific 
to microfluidic technology creates a substantial barrier to entry. To 
address this concern, this article introduces Directed Placement, a 
physical design algorithm that leverages the natural ``directedness'' 
in most modern microfluidic designs: fluid enters at designated 
inputs, flows through a linear or tree-based network of channels and 
fluidic components, and exits the device at dedicated outputs. 
Directed placement creates physical layouts that share many principle 
similarities to those created by domain experts. Directed placement 
allows components to be placed closer to their neighbors compared to 
existing layout algorithms based on planar graph embedding or 
simulated annealing, leading to an average reduction in laid-out fluid 
channel length of 91\% while improving area utilization by 8\% on 
average. Directed placement is compatible with both passive and active

    abstract = {With the rapid growth of application migration, the 
anonymity in data center networks becomes important in breaking attack 
chains and guaranteeing user privacy. However, existing anonymity 
systems are designed for the Internet environment, which suffer from 
high computational and network resource consumption and deliver low 
performance, thus failing to be directly deployed in data centers. In 
order to address this problem, this paper proposes an efficient and 
easily deployed anonymity scheme for software defined networking-based 
data centers, called mimic channel MIC. The main idea behind MIC is to 
conceal the communication participants by modifying the 
source/destination addresses, such as media access control MAC and 
Internet protocol IP address at switch nodes, so as to achieve 
anonymity. Compared with the traditional overlay-based approaches, our 
in-network scheme has shorter transmission paths and less intermediate 
operations, thus achieving higher performance with less overhead. We 
also propose a collision avoidance mechanism to ensure the correctness 
of routing, and three mechanisms to enhance the traffic-analysis 
resistance. To enhance the practicality, we further propose solutions 
to enable MIC co-existing with some MIC-incompatible systems, such as 
packet analysis systems, intrusion detection systems, and firewall 
systems. Our security analysis demonstrates that MIC ensures 
unlinkability and improves traffic-analysis resistance. Our 
experiments show that MIC has extremely low overhead compared with the 
base-line transmission control protocol TCP or secure sockets layer 
SSL, e.g., less than 1\% overhead in terms of throughput. Experiments 
on MIC-based distributed file system show the applicability and 
efficiency of MIC.},

their coding and software development process which may lead to 
insecure programs. Changing this trend in the classroom is quite 
challenging. As a result, a program which appears to be secure at the 
source code level may equate to security vulnerabilities that are 
often exploited by hackers. In this paper, we focus on the 
language-based security main features and standard security mechanisms 
in developing secure programs and avoiding security loopholes. This 
paper takes a step forward in this direction and contributes to 
filling the security gap.},

    abstract = {Twitter has emerged as one of the most popular 
platforms to get updates on entertainment and current events. However, 
due to its 280-character restriction and automatic shortening of URLs, 
it is continuously targeted by cybercriminals to carry out drive-by 
download attacks, where a user{\rq}s system is infected by merely 
visiting a Web page. Popular events that attract a large number of 
users are used by cybercriminals to infect and propagate malware by 
using popular hashtags and creating misleading tweets to lure users to 
malicious Web pages. A drive-by download attack is carried out by 
obfuscating a malicious URL in an enticing tweet and used as clickbait 
to lure users to a malicious Web page. In this article, we answer the 
following two questions: Why are certain malicious tweets retweeted 
more than others? Do emotions reflecting in a tweet drive virality? We 
gathered tweets from seven different sporting events over 3 years and 
identified those tweets that were used to carry to out a drive-by 
download attack. From the malicious (N = 105, 642) and benign (N = 
169, 178) data sample identified, we built models to predict 
information flow size and survival. We define size as the number of 
retweets of an original tweet, and survival as the duration of the 
original tweet{\rq}s presence in the study window. We selected the 
zero-truncated negative binomial (ZTNB) regression method for our 
analysis based on the distribution exhibited by our dependent size 
measure and the comparison of results with other predictive models. We 
used the Cox regression technique to model the survival of information 
flows as it estimates proportional hazard rates for independent 
measures. Our results show that both social and content factors are 
statistically significant for the size and survival of information 
flows for both malicious and benign tweets. In the benign data sample, 
positive emotions and positive sentiment reflected in the tweet 
significantly predict size and survival. In contrast, for the 
malicious data sample, negative emotions, especially fear, are 
associated with both size and survival of information flows.},

posture and motion to control robots in more natural ways. These 
interfaces require the ability to track the body movements of the user

making them ill adapted for applications that need fast deployment. In 
this article, we use consumer-grade armbands, capturing orientation

through a state machine controlled by a body motion classifier. To 
compensate for the low quality of the information of these sensors, 
and to allow a wider range of dynamic control, our approach relies on 
machine learning. We train our classifier directly on the user to 
recognize (within minutes) which physiological state his or her body 
motion expresses. We demonstrate that on top of guaranteeing faster 
field deployment, our algorithm performs better than all comparable 
algorithms, and we detail its configuration and the most significant 
features extracted. As the use of large groups of robots is growing, 
we postulate that their interaction with humans can be eased by our 
approach. We identified the key factors to stimulate engagement using 
our system on 27 participants, each creating his or her own set of 
expressive motions to control a swarm of desk robots. The resulting

incidents. Clock synchronization protocols based on network message 
exchanges, though widely used in current network systems, are 
susceptible to delay attacks against the packet transmission. This 
vulnerability cannot be solved by conventional security measures, such 
as encryption, and remains an open problem. This article proposes to 
use the sine voltage waveform of a utility power grid to synchronize 
network nodes connected to the same grid. Our experiments demonstrate 
that minute fluctuations of the voltage{\rq}s cycle length encode 
fine-grained global time information in Singapore{\rq}s utility grid. 
Based on this key result, we develop a clock synchronization approach 
that achieves good accuracy and is provably secure against 
packet-delay attacks. Implementation results show that our approach 
achieves an average synchronization error of 0.1 ms between two 
network nodes that are deployed in office and residential buildings 10 
km apart. When the proposed system is deployed within the same floor 
of an office building, the error reduces to 10 Î¼s. When there are 
heavy industrial loads close to one of the two nodes 10 km apart, the 
system can still maintain subsecond accuracy. Moreover, when the two 
nodes are deployed within the same building floor with industrial 
loads nearby, the average synchronization error is 34 Î¼},

self-adaptive systems that considers both the current and anticipated 
adaptation needs when making adaptation decisions, taking into account 
the latency of the available adaptation tactics. Since this is a 
problem of selecting adaptation actions in the context of the 
probabilistic behavior of the environment, Markov decision processes 
(MDPs) are a suitable approach. However, given all the possible 
interactions between the different and possibly concurrent adaptation 
tactics, the system, and the environment, constructing the MDP is a 
complex task. Probabilistic model checking has been used to deal with 
this problem, but it requires constructing the MDP every time an 
adaptation decision is made to incorporate the latest predictions of 
the environment behavior. In this article, we describe PLA-SDP, an 
approach that eliminates that runtime overhead by constructing most of

solving the MDP through stochastic dynamic programming, weaving in the 
environment model as the solution is computed. We also present

sufficient in most cases to host application services directly due to 
their intrinsic resource constraints. Fog Computing (FC) can be a 
suitable paradigm to overcome these limitations, as it can coexist and 
cooperate with centralized Cloud systems and extends the latter toward 
the network edge. In this way, it is possible to distribute resources

    abstract = {Identifying free open-source software (FOSS) packages 
on binaries when the source code is unavailable is important for many 
security applications, such as malware detection, software 
infringement, and digital forensics. This capability enhances both the 
accuracy and the efficiency of reverse engineering tasks by avoiding 
false correlations between irrelevant code bases. Although the FOSS 
package identification problem belongs to the field of software 
engineering, conventional approaches rely strongly on practical 
methods in data mining and database searching. However, various 
challenges in the use of these methods prevent existing function 
identification approaches from being effective in the absence of 
source code. To make matters worse, the introduction of obfuscation 
techniques, the use of different compilers and compilation settings, 
and software refactoring techniques has made the automated detection 
of FOSS packages increasingly difficult. With very few exceptions, the 
existing systems are not resilient to such techniques, and the 
exceptions are not sufficiently efficient.To address this issue, we 
propose FOSSIL, a novel resilient and efficient system that 
incorporates three components. The first component extracts the 
syntactical features of functions by considering opcode frequencies 
and applying a hidden Markov model statistical test. The second 
component applies a neighborhood hash graph kernel to random walks 
derived from control-flow graphs, with the goal of extracting the 
semantics of the functions. The third component applies z-score to the 
normalized instructions to extract the behavior of instructions in a 
function. The components are integrated using a Bayesian network 
model, which synthesizes the results to determine the FOSS function. 
The novel approach of combining these components using the Bayesian 
network has produced stronger resilience to code obfuscation.We 
evaluate our system on three datasets, including real-world projects 
whose use of FOSS packages is known, malware binaries for which there 
are security and reverse engineering reports purporting to describe 
their use of FOSS, and a large repository of malware binaries. We 
demonstrate that our system is able to identify FOSS packages in 
real-world projects with a mean precision of 0.95 and with a mean 
recall of 0.85. Furthermore, FOSSIL is able to discover FOSS packages 
in malware binaries that match those listed in security and reverse 
engineering reports. Our results show that modern malware binaries 
contain 0.10--0.45 of FOSS packages.},

additional emotional responses: Love, Sadness, Anger, Wow, and Haha. 
In this article, we examine users{\rq} feedback about this new feature 
and identify important design implications of this significant

of human emotion and emotion-specific influences on cognitive 
appraisals to conduct a heuristic evaluation of Facebook Reactions and 
a thematic content analysis of the 3,000 ``top'' comments posted by 
Facebook users on the official pre- and post-launch announcements 
about Reactions. Prior to launch, many users were concerned that the 
addition of a Dislike button would lead to abuse; thus, they favored 
the more nuanced design of Reactions. After launch, users were more 
positive about the feature as many of their misconceptions were 
clarified through actual use. Overall, we identified several design 
constraints of this new feature, including users{\rq} inability to 
express conflicting emotions. We conclude the article by discussing 
the implications of our findings and the challenges around research

    abstract = {Phishing scam emails are emails that pretend to be 
something they are not in order to get the recipient of the email to 
undertake some action they normally would not. While technical 
protections against phishing reduce the number of phishing emails 
received, they are not perfect and phishing remains one of the largest 
sources of security risk in technology and communication systems. To 
better understand the cognitive process that end users can use to 
identify phishing messages, I interviewed 21 IT experts about 
instances where they successfully identified emails as phishing in 
their own inboxes. IT experts naturally follow a three-stage process 
for identifying phishing emails. In the first stage, the email 
recipient tries to make sense of the email, and understand how it 
relates to other things in their life. As they do this, they notice 
discrepancies: little things that are "off'' about the email. As the 
recipient notices more discrepancies, they feel a need for an 
alternative explanation for the email. At some point, some feature of 
the email --- usually, the presence of a link requesting an action --- 
triggers them to recognize that phishing is a possible alternative 
explanation. At this point, they become suspicious (stage two) and 
investigate the email by looking for technical details that can 
conclusively identify the email as phishing. Once they find such 
information, then they move to stage three and deal with the email by 
deleting it or reporting it. I discuss ways this process can fail, and 
implications for improving training of end users about phishing.},

intermittent learning relating to the data and application semantics

1) an algorithm that determines a sequence of actions to achieve the

propose three heuristics that help an intermittent learner decide 
whether to learn or discard training examples at run-time which 
increases the energy efficiency of the system. We implement and 
evaluate three intermittent learning applications that learn the 1) 
air quality, 2) human presence, and 3) vibration using solar, RF, and

    abstract = {Many information security attacks exploit 
vulnerabilities in ``trusted'' and privileged software executing on 
the system, such as the operating system (OS). On the other hand, most 
security mechanisms provide no immunity to security-critical user 
applications if vulnerabilities are present in the underlying OS. 
While technologies have been proposed that facilitate isolation of 
security-critical software, they require either significant 
computational resources and are hence not applicable to many 
resource-constrained embedded systems, or necessitate extensive 
redesign of the underlying processors and hardware.In this work, we 
propose INVISIOS: a lightweight, minimally intrusive hardware-software 
architecture to make the execution of security-critical software 
invisible to the OS, and hence protected from its vulnerabilities. The 
INVISIOS software architecture encapsulates the security-critical 
software into a self-contained software module. While this module is 
part of the kernel and is run with kernel-level privileges, its code, 
data, and execution are transparent to and protected from the rest of 
the kernel. The INVISIOS hardware architecture consists of simple 
add-on hardware components that are responsible for bootstrapping the 
secure core, ensuring that it is exercised by applications in only 
permitted ways, and enforcing the isolation of its code and data. We 
implemented INVISIOS by enhancing a full-system emulator and Linux to 
model the proposed software and hardware enhancements, and applied it 
to protect a commercial cryptographic library. Our experiments 
demonstrate that INVISIOS is capable of facilitating secure execution 
at very small overheads, making it suitable for resource-constrained 
embedded systems and systems-on-chip.},

insightful upper bound on the average service delay of such

supersede known delay bounds that only work for a single file or

erasure code, placement of encoded chunks, and optimizing scheduling 
policy. The problem is efficiently solved via the computation of a 
sequence of convex approximations with provable convergence. We 
further prototype our solution in an open-source cloud storage

    abstract = {For kinetic-powered body area networks, we explore the 
feasibility of converting energy harvesting patterns for device 
authentication and symmetric secret keys generation continuously. The 
intuition is that at any given time, multiple wearable devices harvest 
kinetic energy from the same user activity, such as walking, which 
allows them to independently observe a common secret energy harvesting 
pattern not accessible to outside devices. Such continuous KEH-based 
authentication and key generation is expected to be highly power 
efficient as it obviates the need to employ any extra sensors, such as 
accelerometer, to precisely track the walking patterns. Unfortunately, 
lack of precise activity tracking introduces bit mismatches between 
the independently generated keys, which makes KEH-based authentication 
and symmetric key generation a challenging problem. We propose KEHKey, 
a KEH-based authentication and key generation system that employs a 
compressive sensing-based information reconciliation protocol for 
wearable devices to effectively correct any mismatches in generated 
keys. We implement KEHKey using off-the-shelf piezoelectric energy 
harvesting products and evaluate its performance with data collected 
from 24 subjects wearing the devices on different body locations 
including head, torso and hands. Our results show that KEHKey is able 
to generate the same key for two KEH-embedded devices at a speed of 
12.57 bps while reducing energy consumption by 59\% compared to 
accelerometer-based methods, which makes it suitable for continuous 
operation. Finally, we demonstrate that KEHKey can successfully defend 
against typical adversarial attacks. In particular, KEHKey is found to 
be more resilient to video side channel attacks than its 
accelerometer-based counterparts.},

computer networks is described, capable of recognizing patterns of 
remote exfiltration occurring over days to weeks. Normal traffic flow 
data, in the form of a host{\rq}s ingress and egress bytes over time, 
is used to train an ensemble of one-class learners. The detection 
ensemble is modular, with individual classifiers trained on different 
traffic features thought to characterize malicious data transfers. We 
select features that model the egress to ingress byte balance over 
time, periodicity, short timescale irregularity, and density of the 
traffic. The features are most efficiently modeled in the frequency 
domain, which has the added benefit that variable duration flows are 
transformed to a fixed-size feature vector, and by sampling the 
frequency space appropriately, long-duration flows can be tested. When 
trained on days or weeks worth of traffic from individual hosts, our 
ensemble achieves a low false-positive rate (<2\%) on a range of 
different system types. Simulated exfiltration samples with a variety 
of different timing and data characteristics were generated and used 
to test ensemble performance on different kinds of systems: When 
trained on a client workstation{\rq}s external traffic, the ensemble 
was generally successful at detecting exfiltration that is not 
simultaneously ingress-heavy, connection-sparse, and of short 
duration---a combination that is not optimal for attackers seeking to 
transfer large amounts of data. Remote exfiltration is more difficult 
to detect from egress-heavy systems, like web servers, with normal

relationships and develop socially, emotionally and morally, but it 
also gives rise to certain forms of online behaviour, such as 
cybergossip, which are associated with cyberaggression and other risky 
behaviour. The aims of this study were to verify whether a 
longitudinal association exists between cybergossip and 
cyberaggression, and to discover which mechanisms of moral 
disengagement may mediate this relationship. The final sample 
consisted of 1392 students (50\% girls; Mage = 13.47; SD = 0.77), who 
were surveyed in a three-wave longitudinal study at six-month 
intervals. The results obtained confirmed a direct, positive 
relationship between cybergossip, subsequent cyberaggression and the 
mediation exerted by cognitive restructuring in this transition. We 
discuss the importance of recognizing and detecting the fine 
distinction between online gossip and cyberaggression with the 
intention of doing harm, and focus on the justifications used by young 
people to normalize online bullying. To sum up, there is a clear need 
to encourage ethical, responsible behaviour in online interactions in 
order to achieve well-balanced, more sustainable relationships in

implementations of explicit model-predictive controllers (MPC) for 
robust control of linear time-invariant (LTI) systems on embedded 
platforms. We obtain an explicit-form robust model-predictive 
controller as a solution to a multi-parametric linear programming 
problem. The structure of the controller is a polyhedral decomposition 
of the control domain, with an affine map for each domain. While 
explicit MPC is suited for embedded devices with low computational 
power, the memory requirements for such controllers can be high. We 
provide an optimization algorithm for a mixed-precision implementation 
of the controller, where the deviation of the implemented controller 
from the original one is within the robustness margin of the robust 
control problem. The core of the mixed-precision optimization is an 
iterative static analysis that co-designs a robust controller and a 
low-bitwidth approximation that is statically guaranteed to always be 
within the robustness margin of the original controller. We have 
implemented our algorithm and show on a set of benchmarks that our 
optimization can reduce space requirements by up to 20.9\% and on 
average by 12.6\% compared to a minimal uniform precision

Bioinformatics, social networks, Web and cyber-security. Graph pattern 
mining has become an important tool in the management and analysis of 
complexly structured data, where example applications include 
indexing, clustering and classification. Existing graph mining 
algorithms have achieved great success by exploiting various 
properties in the pattern space. Unfortunately, due to the fundamental 
role subgraph isomorphism plays in these methods, they may all enter 
into a pitfall when the cost to enumerate a huge set of isomorphic 
embeddings blows up, especially in large graphs.The solution we 
propose for this problem resorts to reduction on the data space. For 
each graph, we build a summary of it and mine this shrunk graph 
instead. Compared to other data reduction techniques that either 
reduce the number of transactions or compress between transactions, 
this new framework, called Summarize-Mine, suggests a third path by 
compressing within transactions. Summarize-Mine is effective in 
cutting down the size of graphs, thus decreasing the embedding 
enumeration cost. However, compression might lose patterns at the same 
time. We address this issue by generating randomized summaries and 
repeating the process for multiple rounds, where the main idea is that 
true patterns are unlikely to miss from all rounds. We provide strict 
probabilistic guarantees on pattern loss likelihood. Experiments on 
real malware trace data show that Summarize-Mine is very efficient, 
which can find interesting malware fingerprints that were not revealed 
previously.},

@article{10.1109/TNET.2016.2594481,
    abstract = {This paper concerns the practically important problem 
of multi-category radio frequency identification RFID estimation: 
given a set of RFID tags, we want to quickly and accurately estimate 
the number of tags in each category. However, almost all the existing 
RFID estimation protocols are dedicated to the estimation problem on a 
single set, regardless of tag categories. A feasible solution is to 
separately execute the existing estimation protocols on each category. 
The execution time of such a serial solution is proportional to the 
number of categories, and cannot satisfy the delay-stringent 
application scenarios. Simultaneous RIFD estimation over multiple 
categories is desirable, and hence, this paper proposes an approach 
called simultaneous estimation for multi-category RFID systems SEM. 
SEM exploits the Manchester-coding mechanism, which is supported by 
the ISO 18000-6 RFID standard, to decode the combined signals, thereby 
simultaneously obtaining the reply status of tags from each category. 
As a result, multiple bit vectors are decoded from just one physical 
slotted frame. Built on our SEM, many existing excellent estimation 
protocols can be used to estimate the tag cardinality of each category 
in a simultaneous manner. To ensure the predefined accuracy, we 
calculate the variance of the estimate in one round, as well as the 
variance of the average estimate in multiple rounds. To find the 
optimal frame size, we propose an efficient binary search-based 
algorithm. To address significant variance in category sizes, we 
propose an adaptive partitioning AP strategy to group categories of 
similar sizes together and execute the estimation protocol for each 
group separately. Compared with the existing protocols, our approach 
is much faster, meanwhile satisfying the predefined estimation 
accuracy. For example, with 20 categories, the proposed SEM+AP is 
about seven times faster than prior estimation schemes. Moreover, our 
approach is the only one whose normalized estimation time i.e., time 
per category decreases as the number of categories increases.},

widely applied in product manufacturing. However, the emerging 
unauthorized access of 3D printing data, as well as the growth in the 
pervasiveness and capability of 3D printing devices have raised 
serious concerns about 3D printing product anti-counterfeit. 
Electronic product tags are the current standard for authentication 
purposes; however, often this technology is neither secure nor 
cost-effective, and fails to take advantage of other unique 3D 
printing features. Considering the great usability of the QR code, we 
are motivated to enhance the QR code for the practical and 
cost-effective 3D printing product identification. Particularly, we 
bring up the all-in-one design, all-in-one manufacturing concept 
incorporating the QR code in the complete 3D printing paradigm. In 
detail, we explore the possibility of leveraging the random and 
uncontrollable process variations in the 3D printing system to 
generate a unique fingerprint for the integrated QR code. To this end, 
we present an end-to-end 3D-printed QR code verification framework, 
which does not change the original QR protocol and functionality. The 
entire solution can be implemented with commodity 3D printers and 
smartphones. Specifically, we first investigate the inevitable and 
random process variations in the 3D printing mechanism and analyze the 
causality between the variations and detectable geometric deformation. 
We further develop a fingerprint extraction algorithm taking into 
account both the QR code property and the 3D printer characteristics. 
The system evaluation indicates that our solution is secure and robust

commercial networks has created the need for high-speed archival 
solutions that continuously store streaming network data to enable 
forensic analysis and auditing. However, "turning back the clock" for 
post-attack analyses is not a trivial task. The first major challenge 
is that the solution has to sustain data archiving under extremely 
high-speed insertion rates. Moreover, the archives created need to be 
stored in a format that is compressed but still amenable to indexing. 
The above requirements make general-purpose databases unsuitable for 
this task, and, thus, dedicated solutions are required.In this paper, 
we describe a prototype solution that satisfies all requirements for 
high-speed archival storage, indexing and data querying on network 
flow information. The superior performance of our approach is 
attributed to the on-the-fly compression and indexing scheme, which is 
based on compressed bitmap principles. Typical commercial solutions 
can currently process 20,000--60,000 flows per second. An evaluation 
of our prototype implementation on current commodity hardware using 
real-world traffic traces shows its ability to sustain insertion rates 
ranging from 500,000 to more than 1 million records per second. The 
system offers interactive query response times that enable 
administrators to perform complex analysis tasks on-the-fly. Our 
technique is directly amenable to parallel execution, allowing its 
application in domains that are challenged by large volumes of

behavior analysis and large-scale data visualization in service

    abstract = {Recent studies have exploited moving target defense 
(MTD) for thwarting false data injection (FDI) attacks against the 
state estimation (SE) by actively perturbing branch parameters (i.e., 
impedance or admittance) in power grids. To hide the activation of MTD 
from attackers, a new strategy named hidden MTD has been proposed by 
the latest literature. A hidden MTD can increase the defender{\rq}s 
chance to detect FDI attacks and avoid the attacker from inferring new 
branch parameters. However, by using an MTD-confirming detector like 
the bad data detection (BDD) checker in SE, we observe that it is 
still possible for the attacker to detect this hidden MTD when the 
power flows change with time. To uncover the insight of MTD{\rq}s 
hiddenness, we study the conditions needed for achieving a hidable 
MTD. We find that the hiddenness of MTD is closely related to the 
branch perturbations, system topology, and attacker{\rq}s knowledge. 
From the attacker{\rq}s perspective, we prove that an MTD can be 
detected by the attacker only if he/she knows the previous parameters 
of a set of branches that forms a circle and the measurements 
corresponding to those branches after MTD. But once the attacker has 
full knowledge of branch parameters before MTD and has obtained all 
measurements after MTD, it is proved that we can never achieve a 
hidable and effective MTD. From the defender{\rq}s perspective, since 
it is impossible to know the attacker{\rq}s capability, we cannot 
determine whether a constructed MTD is hidable or not by purely 
depending on the MTD design. To address this issue, we propose that, 
by protecting a basic set of measurements, we always can achieve a 
hidable and effective MTD regardless of the changes of power flows, 
the attacker{\rq}s knowledge, and the branch perturbations. 
Furthermore, we validate our findings with the IEEE standard test 
power systems.},

@article{10.1109/TNET.2019.2940369,
    abstract = {Internet interconnections are the means by which 
networks exchange traffic between one another. These interconnections 
are typically established in facilities that have known geographic 
locations, and are owned and operated by so-called colocation and 
interconnection services providers e.g., Equinix, CoreSite, and 
EdgeConneX. These previously under-studied colocation facilities and 
the critical role they play in solving the notoriously difficult 
problem of obtaining a comprehensive view of the structure and 
evolution of the interconnections in today{\rq}s Internet are the 
focus of this paper. We present $tt {mi}^{2}$ , a new approach for 
mapping Internet interconnections inside a given colocation facility.1 
We infer the existence of interconnections from localized traceroutes 
and use the Belief Propagation algorithm on a specially defined Markov 
Random Field graphical model to geolocate them to a target colocation 
facility. We evaluate $tt {mi}^{2}$ by applying it initially to a 
small set of US-based colocation facilities. In the process, we 
compare our results against those obtained by two recently developed 
related techniques and discuss observed discrepancies that derive from 
how the different techniques determine the ownership of border 
routers. As part of our validation approach, we also identify drastic 
changes in today{\rq}s Internet interconnection ecosystem e.g., new 
infrastructures in the form of ``cloud exchanges'' that offer new 
types of interconnections called ``virtual private interconnections'', 
and discuss their wide-ranging implications for obtaining an accurate 
and comprehensive map of the Internet{\rq}s interconnection fabric.1An 
open-source prototype of $tt {mi}^{2}$ is available at our project 
website located at https://onrg.gitlab.io/projects/mii},

    abstract = {Network level surveillance, censorship, and various 
man-in-the-middle attacks target only specific types of network 
traffic (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS, VoIP, or Email). Therefore, packets of 
these types will likely receive ``special'' treatment by a transit 
network or a man-in-the-middle attacker. A transit Internet Service 
Provider (ISP) or an attacker may pass the targeted traffic through 
special software or equipment to gather data or perform an attack. 
This creates a measurable difference between the performance of the 
targeted traffic versus the general case. In networking terms, it 
violates the principle of ``network neutrality,'' which states that 
all traffic should be treated equally. Many techniques were designed 
to detect network neutrality violations, and some have naturally 
suggested using them to detect surveillance and censorship. In this 
article, we show that the existing network neutrality measurement 
techniques can be easily detected and therefore circumvented. We then 
briefly propose a new approach to overcome the drawbacks of current 
measurement techniques.},

@article{10.1145/3032963,
    abstract = {Obscenity (the use of rude words or offensive 
expressions) has spread from informal verbal conversations to digital 
media, becoming increasingly common on user-generated comments found 
in Web forums, newspaper user boards, social networks, blogs, and 
media-sharing sites. The basic obscenity-blocking mechanism is based 
on verbatim comparisons against a blacklist of banned vocabulary; 
however, creative users circumvent these filters by obfuscating 
obscenity with symbol substitutions or bogus segmentations that still 
visually preserve the original semantics, such as writing shit as 
$h!`;t or s.h.i.t or even worse mixing them as $.h{\ldots}.!`.t. The 
number of potential obfuscated variants is combinatorial, yielding the 
verbatim filter impractical. Here we describe a method intended to 
obstruct this anomaly inspired by sequence alignment algorithms used 
in genomics, coupled with a tailor-made edit penalty function. The 
method only requires to set up the vocabulary of plain obscenities; no 
further training is needed. Its complexity on screening a single 
obscenity is linear, both in runtime and memory, on the length of the 
user-generated text. We validated the method on three different 
experiments. The first one involves a new dataset that is also 
introduced in this article; it consists of a set of manually annotated 
real-life comments in Spanish, gathered from the news user boards of 
an online newspaper, containing this type of obfuscation. The second 
one is a publicly available dataset of comments in Portuguese from a 
sports Web site. In these experiments, at the obscenity level, we 
observed recall rates greater than 90\%, whereas precision rates 
varied between 75\% and 95\%, depending on their sequence length 
(shorter lengths yielded a higher number of false alarms). On the 
other hand, at the comment level, we report recall of 86\%, precision 
of 91\%, and specificity of 98\%. The last experiment revealed that 
the method is more effective in matching this type of obfuscation 
compared to the classical Levenshtein edit distance. We conclude 
discussing the prospects of the method to help enforcing moderation 
rules of obscenity expressions or as a preprocessing mechanism for 
sequence cleaning and/or feature extraction in more sophisticated text 
categorization techniques.},

digitization of the information that many day-to-day systems depend 
upon. The demand for cybersecurity analysts outpaces supply, which 
calls for optimal management of the analyst resource. Therefore, a key 
component of the cybersecurity defense system is the optimal 
scheduling of its analysts. Sensor data is analyzed by automatic 
processing systems, and alerts are generated. A portion of these 
alerts is considered to be significant, which requires thorough 
examination by a cybersecurity analyst. Risk, in this article, is 
defined as the percentage of unanalyzed or not thoroughly analyzed 
alerts among the significant alerts by analysts. The article presents 
a generalized optimization model for scheduling cybersecurity analysts 
to minimize risk (a.k.a., maximize significant alert coverage by 
analysts) and maintain risk under a pre-determined upper bound. The 
article tests the optimization model and its scalability on a set of 
given sensors with varying analyst experiences, alert generation 
rates, system constraints, and system requirements. Results indicate 
that the optimization model is scalable and is capable of identifying 
both the right mix of analyst expertise in an organization and the 
sensor-to-analyst allocation in order to maintain risk below a given 
upper bound. Several meta-principles are presented, which are derived 
from the optimization model, and they further serve as guiding 
principles for hiring and scheduling cybersecurity analysts. The 
simulation studies (validation) of the optimization model outputs

    abstract = {The blood vessels are the most critical part of the 
human circulatory system. Information acquired on the structure and 
status of blood vessels drives the development of numerous medical and 
biometric applications. Therefore, it is of paramount importance to 
find an effective way to sense vessel structures. Traditional methods, 
including infrared and Doppler sensing modalities, are limited by 
optical diffusion and ultrasonic scattering that are not good at 
vessel sensing with high performance. In comparison, we argue 
photoacoustic (PA) sensing is an emerging technique that can image 3D 
vessel structure deep in tissue with high-resolution visualization, 
maintaining the advantages of both optical and ultrasound methods. In 
this work, we propose and develop PAvessel, a practical 3D vessel 
structure sensing system based on PA effects. The entire sensing 
system comprises two key components, PA sensing hardware and PA 
sensing software. Specifically, the hardware mainly consists of a 
linear ultrasound transducer array, an ultrasound data acquisition 
system, and a neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet (Nd:YAG) laser. 
After receiving the PA raw data, we use the advanced image 
reconstruction and 3D photoacoustic vein model to establish the 3D 
vessel structure model. We validated its effectiveness, 
cost-effectiveness and high resolution of PAvessel in the evaluation. 
The system achieves 52\% higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) compared 
to the other methods. Furthermore, considering the 3D palm vein 
contains high dimensional human features and is almost impossible to 
forge, we also explored its applications in palm biometrics. In a 
pilot study with 10 participants, PAvessel, combined with a 3D vessel 
structure matching algorithm (EMD-VT), has proven to possess high 
accuracy and robustness as a biometric. PAvessel achieves the 
precision and recall of 98.33\% and 97.37\%, respectively.},

    abstract = {With billions of networked connected embedded systems, 
the security historically provided by the isolation of embedded 
systems is no longer sufficient. Millions of new malware are created 
every month and zero-day attacks are becoming an increasing concern. 
Therefore, proactive security measures are no longer enough to provide 
protection to embedded systems. Instead, reactive approaches that 
detect attacks that can circumvent the proactive defenses and react 
upon them are needed. Anomaly-based detection is a common reactive 
approach employed to detect malware by monitoring anomalous deviations 
in the system execution. Timing-based anomaly detection detects 
malware by monitoring the system's internal timing, which offers 
unique protection against mimicry malware compared to sequence-based 
anomaly detection. However, previous timing-based anomaly detection 
methods focus on each operation independently at the granularity of 
tasks, function calls, system calls, or basic blocks. These approaches 
neither consider the entire software execution path nor provide a 
quantitative estimate of the presence of malware. This article 
presents a novel model for specifying the normal timing for execution 
paths in software applications using cumulative distribution functions 
of timing data in sliding execution windows. A probabilistic 
formulation is used to estimate the presence of malware for individual 
operations and sequences of operations within the paths. Operation and 
path-based thresholds are determined during the training process to 
minimize false positives. Finally, the article presents an 
optimization method to assist system developers in selecting which 
operations to monitor based on different optimization goals and 
constraints. Experimental results with a smart connected pacemaker, an 
unmanned aerial vehicle, and seven sophisticated mimicry malware 
implemented at different levels demonstrate the effectiveness of the 
proposed approach.},

controlled loads, and we give simulation results to show how its 
performance degrades as the sampling frequency decreases. 
Additionally, we introduce a new privacy metric, which we call 
inferential privacy. This privacy metric assumes a strong adversary

infer a private parameter, independent of the algorithm he uses. 
Combining these two results allows us to directly consider the

last few years, not only enabling people to connect with each other by 
social links, but also providing platforms for people to share 
information and interact over diverse topics. Rich user-generated 
information, for example, users{\rq} relationships and daily posts, 
are often available in most social media service websites. Given such 
information, a challenging problem is to provide reasonable user and 
community recommendation for a target user, and consequently, help the 
target user engage in the daily discussions and activities with

unified framework of recommending users and communities that utilizes 
the information in social media. Given a user{\rq}s profile or a set 
of keywords as input, our framework is capable of recommending 
influential users and topic-cohesive interactive communities that are 
most relevant to the given user or keywords. With the proposed 
framework, users can find other individuals or communities sharing 
similar interests, and then have more interaction with these users or 
within the communities. We present a generative topic model to 
discover user-oriented and community-oriented topics simultaneously, 
which enables us to capture the exact topical interests of users, as 
well as the focuses of communities. Extensive experimental evaluation

    abstract = {Many clock synchronization protocols based on message 
passing, e.g., the Network Time Protocol (NTP), assume symmetric 
network delays to estimate the one-way packet transmission time as 
half of the round-trip time. As a result, asymmetric network delays 
caused by either network congestion or malicious packet delays can 
cause significant synchronization errors. This article exploits 
sinusoidal voltage signals of an alternating current (AC) power grid 
to limit the impact of the asymmetric network delays on these clock 
synchronization protocols. Our extensive measurements show that the 
voltage signals at geographically distributed locations in a city are 
highly synchronized. Leveraging calibrated voltage phases, we develop 
a new clock synchronization protocol that we call Grid Time Protocol 
(GTP), which allows direct measurement of one-way packet transmission 
times between its slave and master nodes, subject to an analytic 
condition that can be easily verified in practice. The direct 
measurements render GTP resilient against asymmetric network delays 
under this condition. A prototype implementation of GTP maintains 
sub-millisecond synchronization accuracy for two nodes tens of 
kilometers apart in the presence of malicious packet delays. The 
result has been demonstrated for both Singapore and Hangzhou, China. 
Simulations driven by real network delay measurements between 
Singapore and Hangzhou under both normal and congested network 
conditions also show the synchronization accuracy improvement by GTP. 
We believe that GTP is suitable for grid-connected distributed systems 
that are currently served by NTP but desire higher resilience against 
unfavorable network dynamics and packet delay attacks.},

likely to close (each doubling in trade volume corresponds to a 12\% 
decrease in the odds of closure). We also find that exchanges that

is sensed by the other antenna that was obstructed by the person. 
Then, Pearson Coefficient and crest comparison algorithms are adopted 
to match the theoretical and actual RF-signal curves on the two sides, 
respectively. Additionally, a starting point acquisition method is

targets for cyberattacks these days. One type of network topology for 
WSNs, the scale-free topology, can effectively withstand random 
attacks in which the nodes in the topology are randomly selected as 
targets. However, it is fragile to malicious attacks in which the 
nodes with high node degrees are selected as targets. Thus, how to 
improve the robustness of the scale-free topology against malicious 
attacks becomes a critical issue. To tackle this problem, this paper 
proposes a Robustness Optimization scheme with multi-population 
Co-evolution for scale-free wireless sensor networKS ROCKS to improve 
the robustness of the scale-free topology. We build initial scale-free 
topologies according to the characteristics of WSNs in the real-world 
environment. Then, we apply our ROCKS with novel crossover operator 
and mutation operator to optimize the robustness of the scale-free 
topologies constructed for WSNs. For a scale-free WSNs topology, our 
proposed algorithm keeps the initial degree of each node unchanged 
such that the optimized topology remains scale-free. Based on a 
well-known metric for the robustness against malicious attacks, our 
experiment results show that ROCKS roughly doubles the robustness of 
initial scale-free WSNs, and outperforms two existing algorithms by 
about 16\% when the network size is large.},

To manage these challenges, there has been a surge of interest in 
building decentralized control schemes, where a pool of DERs combined 
with energy storage devices can exchange energy locally to smooth 
fluctuations in net demand. Building a decentralized market for 
transactive microgrids is challenging, because even though a 
decentralized system provides resilience, it also must satisfy 
requirements such as privacy, efficiency, safety, and security, which 
are often in conflict with each other. As such, existing 
implementations of decentralized markets often focus on resilience and 
safety but compromise on privacy. In this article, we describe our 
platform, called TRANSAX, which enables participants to trade in an 
energy futures market, which improves efficiency by finding feasible 
matches for energy trades, enabling DSOs to plan their energy needs 
better. TRANSAX provides privacy to participants by anonymizing their 
trading activity using a distributed mixing service, while also 
enforcing constraints that limit trading activity based on safety 
requirements, such as keeping planned energy flow below line capacity. 
We show that TRANSAX can satisfy the seemingly conflicting 
requirements of efficiency, safety, and privacy. We also provide an 
analysis of how much trading efficiency is lost. Trading efficiency is 
improved through the problem formulation, which accounts for temporal 
flexibility, and system efficiency is improved using a hybrid-solver 
architecture. Finally, we describe a testbed to run experiments and 
demonstrate its performance using simulation results.},

participants can identify products and create product data to record 
the product particulars in transit. Participants along the supply 
chain share their product data to enable information exchange and 
support critical decisions in production operations. Such an

mechanism when the product data relate to sensitive business issues. 
However, existing access control solutions are ill-suited to the

perform poorly to support privilege revocation of product data. We 
present a new scalable industry data access control system that 
addresses these limitations. Our system provides an item-level data 
access control mechanism that defines and enforces access policies 
based on both the participants{\rq} role attributes and the

to delegate encryption updates in revocation operation without 
disclosing the underlying data contents. We design a new updatable

capacity. With more spectrum bands opened up for CR use, it is 
critical yet challenging to perform efficient wideband sensing. We 
propose an integrated sequential wideband sensing scheduling framework

CS techniques for more accurate and lower-cost spectrum sensing. 
First, to ensure more timely detection without incurring high overhead 
involved in periodic recovery of CS signals, we propose smart 
scheduling of a CS-based sequential wideband detection scheme to 
effectively detect the PU activities in the wideband of interest. 
Second, to further help users under severe channel conditions identify 
the occupied sub-channels, we develop two collaborative strategies, 
namely, joint reconstruction of the signals among neighboring users 
and wideband sensing-map fusion. Third, to achieve robust wideband 
sensing, we propose the use of anomaly detection in our framework. 
Extensive simulations demonstrate that our approach outperforms peer

multimedia devices is growing extensively. These multimedia devices 
that communicate among each other through the Internet form a unique 
paradigm called the Internet of Multimedia Things (IoMT). As the 
volume of the collected data in multimedia application increases, the

which helps to detect any attack effectively. In this regard, the 
combination of SDN and IoMT, termed SD-IoMT, has the immense ability 
to improve the network management and security capabilities of the IoT 
system. This article proposes an SDN-assisted two-phase detection 
framework, namely SD-IoMT-Protector, in which the first phase utilizes 
the entropy technique as the detection metric to verify and alert 
about the malicious traffic. The second phase has trained with an

deployed in many practical settings, bringing new security risks, 
e.g., SDN controller and switch hijacking. In this paper, we propose a 
real-time method to detect compromised SDN devices in a reliable way. 
The proposed method aims at solving the detection problem of 
compromised SDN devices when both the controller and the switch are 
trustless, and it is complementary with existing detection methods. 
Our primary idea is to employ backup controllers to audit the handling 
information of network update events collected from the primary 
controller and its switches, and to detect compromised devices by 
recognizing inconsistent or unexpected handling behaviors among the 
primary controller, backup controllers, and switches. Following this 
idea, we first capture each network update request and its execution 
result in the primary controller, collect each received network update 
instruction and the information of any state update in switches, and 
deliver these four kinds of information to those backup controllers in 
an auditor role. An auditor controller is designed to create an audit 
record for each received network update request and to add its 
execution result of this network update request as well as the 
received four kinds of matching information to the audit record. In 
particular, heterogeneous auditor controllers are proposed to avoid 
the same vulnerability with the primary controller. The audit 
algorithm and theoretical proof of its effectiveness for security 
enhancement are then presented. Finally, based on our prototype 
implementation, our experimental results further validate the proposed 
method and its low costs.},

in software that executes on a programmable processor. The components 
of SDR, such as the filters, amplifiers, and modulators, can be easily 
reconfigured to adapt to the operating environment and user 
preferences. However, the flexibility of radio reconfiguration brings 
along the serious security concern of malicious modification of 
software in the SDR system, leading to radio malfunction and 
interference with other users' communications. Both the SDR device and 
the network need to be protected from such malicious radio 
reconfiguration.In this article, a new architecture targeted at 
protecting SDR devices from malicious reconfiguration is proposed. The 
architecture is based on robust separation of the radio operation 
environment and user application environment, through the use of 
virtualization. A new radio middleware layer is designed to securely 
intercept all attempts to reconfigure the radio, and a security policy 
monitor checks the target configuration against security policies that 
represent the interests of various parties. Even if the operating 
system in the user application environment is compromised, the 
proposed architecture can ensure secure reconfiguration in the radio 
operation environment. We have prototyped the proposed secure SDR 
architecture using VMware and the GNU Radio toolkit and demonstrate 
that overheads incurred by the architecture are small and tolerable. 
Therefore, we believe that the proposed solution could be applied to

things (IoT) applications is more complicated than that for desktop, 
mobile, or web applications. First, IoT applications require both 
software and hardware to work together across many different types of 
nodes with different capabilities under different conditions. Second, 
IoT application development involves different types of software 
engineers such as desktop, web, embedded, and mobile to work together. 
Furthermore, non-software engineering personnel such as business 
analysts are also involved in the design process. In addition to the 
complexity of having multiple software engineering specialists 
cooperating to merge different hardware and software components 
together, the development process requires different software and 
hardware stacks to be integrated together (e.g., different stacks from 
different companies such as Microsoft Azure and IBM Bluemix). Due to 
the above complexities, non-functional requirements (such as security

tend to be ignored or treated as though they are less important in the

    abstract = {Blockchain is a disruptive technology that has 
attracted the attention of the scientific community and companies, as 
proven by the exponential growth of publications on this topic in 
recent years. This growing interest is mainly due to the promise that 
the use of blockchain enables it to be verified, without including any 
trusted intermediaries, that the information received from the network 
is authentic and up-to-date. In this respect, blockchain is a 
distributed database that can be seen as a ledger that records all 
transactions that have ever been executed. In this context, smart 
contracts are pieces of software used to facilitate, verify, and 
enforce the negotiation of a transaction on a blockchain platform. 
These pieces of software are implemented by using programming 
languages, which are sometimes provided by the blockchain platforms 
themselves. This study aims to (1) identify and categorise the 
state-of-the-art related to smart contract languages, in terms of the 
existing languages and their main features, and (2) identify new 
research opportunities. The review has been conducted as a multivocal 
mapping study that follows the guidelines proposed by Garousi et al. 
for conducting multivocal literature reviews, as well as the 
guidelines proposed by Kitchenham and Charters for conducting mapping 
studies. As a result of the implementation of the review protocol,

and their implications for future research have been outlined. As a 
conclusion, it could be stated that a rigorous and replicable overview

    abstract = {United States Army Special Forces who deployed to Iraq 
in mid-2014, and who were seeking to help Iraqi forces to combat 
Islamic State (ISIL) faced a considerable challenge: how could a force 
of fewer than 50 operators provide guidance and support to their Iraqi 
allies (mostly Iraqi Special Forces units who had been trained by U.S. 
forces prior to the U.S. withdrawal from Iraq in 2011) while also 
keeping in line with Washington{\rq}s policy of seeking to avoid any 
possibility of combat casualties among deployed U.S. Special Forces? 
Their solution to this dilemma came to be dubbed {\lq}Remote Advise 
and Assist{\rq} (RAA). By cobbling together a system of voice and text 
communications, cameras, interactive maps and mobile handsets, these 
Special Forces personnel found they could {\lq}virtually 
accompany{\rq} their Iraqi partners into hot zones where U.S. boots on 
the ground were forbidden. This approach seems to have been extremely 
successful, but potentially raises a range of ethical concerns. 
Against the backdrop of a general account of the ethics of employing 
surrogate forces, this paper explores the ethical questions raised by 
the practice of {\lq}Remote Advise and Assist{\rq}.},

codes to protect against disk and node failures to increase 
reliability, while trying to meet the latency requirements of the

cache such that the code formed by the chunks in storage nodes and 
cache combined are maximal-distance-separable erasure codes. Based on 
the arrival rates of different files, placement of file chunks on the 
servers, and the service time distribution of storage servers, an 
optimal functional caching placement and the access probabilities of 
the file request from different disks are considered. The proposed 
algorithm gives significant latency improvement in both simulations

    abstract = {Robotic vehicles (RV) are increasing in adoption in 
many industrial sectors. RVs use auto-pilot software for perception 
and navigation and rely on sensors and actuators for operating 
autonomously in the physical world. Control algorithms have been used 
in RVs to minimize the effects of noisy sensors, prevent faulty 
actuator output, and, recently, to detect attacks against RVs. In this 
article, we demonstrate the vulnerabilities in control-based intrusion 
detection techniques and propose three kinds of stealthy attacks that 
evade detection and disrupt RV missions. We also propose automated 
algorithms for performing the attacks without requiring the attacker 
to expend significant effort or to know specific details of the RV, 
thus making the attacks applicable to a wide range of RVs. We 
demonstrate the attacks on eight RV systems including three real 
vehicles in the presence of an Intrusion Detection System using 
control-based techniques to monitor RV{\rq}s runtime behavior and 
detect attacks. We find that the control-based techniques are 
incapable of detecting our stealthy attacks and that the attacks can 
have significant adverse impact on the RV{\rq}s mission (e.g., deviate 
it significantly from its target, or cause it to crash).},

European economy and society, new technologies have emerged bringing 
new opportunities for the benefit of citizens, public administrations

This article aims to provide an overview of how DLTs could be

well as discussing some legal challenges that might appear. Taking 
into account the proof of concept of all the existing projects in this 
field, DLTs promise to provide procuring with a high level of

cycles. While the architecture of a Blockchain-based public 
procurement scheme is constrained by the immaturity of the technology, 
it is observed that the establishment of private ledgers (or 
public-permissioned ledgers) in tender procedures might be more 
suitable to public procurement. Although the process of implementation 
might be costly and less feasible in comparison with other fields in 
the public sector, initiatives focusing on this area should be 
endorsed. Ultimately, the successful implementation of DLTs in the 
governance of public procurement is inconceivable without a 
far-reaching professionalisation of procurement practitioners.

    abstract = {Most existing wireless networking solutions are 
best-effort and do not provide any delay guarantee required by 
important applications, such as mobile multimedia conferencing and 
real-time control of cyber-physical systems. Recently, Hou and Kumar 
provided a novel framework for analyzing and designing 
delay-guaranteed wireless networking solutions. While inspiring, their 
idle-time-based analysis applies only to flows with a special traffic 
pattern called the frame-synchronized setting. The problem remains 
largely open for general traffic patterns. This paper addresses this 
challenge by proposing a general framework that characterizes and 
achieves the complete delay-constrained capacity region with general 
traffic patterns in single-hop downlink access-point wireless 
networks. We first show that the timely wireless flow problem is 
fundamentally an infinite-horizon Markov decision process MDP. Then, 
we judiciously combine different simplification methods to prove that 
the timely capacity region can be characterized by a finite-size 
convex polygon. This for the first time allows us to characterize the 
timely capacity region of wireless flows with general traffic 
patterns. We then design three scheduling policies to optimize network 
utility and/or support feasible timely throughput vectors for general 
traffic patterns. The first policy achieves the optimal network 
utility and supports any feasible timely throughput vector but suffers 
from the curse of dimensionality. The second and third policies are 
inspired by our MDP framework and are of much lower complexity. 
Simulation results show that both achieve near-optimal performance and 
outperform other existing alternatives.},

physical surroundings, it behooves the research community to 
understand the characteristics of webcams' distribution and their 
privacy/security implications. In this paper, we conduct the first 
systematic study on live webcams from both aggregation sites and 
individual webcams (webpages/IP hosts). We propose a series of 
efficient, automated techniques for detecting and fingerprinting live 
webcams. In particular, we leverage distributed algorithms to detect 
aggregation sites and generate webcam fingerprints by utilizing the 
Graphical User Interface (GUI) of the built-in web server of a device. 
Overall, we observe 0.85 million webpages from aggregation sites 
hosting live webcams and 2.2 million live webcams in the public IPv4 
space. Our study reveals that aggregation sites have a typical 
long-tail distribution in hosting live streams (5.8\% of sites contain 
90.44\% of live streaming contents), and 85.4\% of aggregation 
websites scrape webcams from others. Further, we observe that (1) 
277,239 webcams from aggregation sites and IP hosts (11.7\%) directly 
expose live streams to the public, (2) aggregation sites expose 
187,897 geolocation names and more detailed 23,083 longitude/latitude 
pairs of webcams, (3) the default usernames and passwords of 38,942 
webcams are visible on aggregation sites in plaintext, and (4) 1,237 
webcams are detected as having been compromised to conduct malicious 
behaviors.},

    abstract = {Machine learning (ML) has become increasingly 
influential to human society, yet the primary advancements and 
applications of ML are driven by research in only a few computational 
disciplines. Even applications that affect or analyze human behaviors 
and social structures are often developed with limited input from 
experts outside of computational fields. Social scientists---experts 
trained to examine and explain the complexity of human behavior and 
interactions in the world---have considerable expertise to contribute 
to the development of ML applications for human-generated data, and 
their analytic practices could benefit from more human-centered ML 
methods. Although a few researchers have highlighted some gaps between 
ML and social sciences [51, 57, 70], most discussions only focus on 
quantitative methods. Yet many social science disciplines rely heavily 
on qualitative methods to distill patterns that are challenging to 
discover through quantitative data. One common analysis method for 
qualitative data is qualitative coding. In this article, we highlight 
three challenges of applying ML to qualitative coding. Additionally, 
we utilize our experience of designing a visual analytics tool for 
collaborative qualitative coding to demonstrate the potential in using 
ML to support qualitative coding by shifting the focus to identifying 
ambiguity. We illustrate dimensions of ambiguity and discuss the 
relationship between disagreement and ambiguity. Finally, we propose 
three research directions to ground ML applications for social science

systems, there is a growing enthusiasm to develop methods to support 
the development of privacy aware software systems. Inadequate privacy

systems that may not protect user privacy appropriately. To

used in agriculture monitoring to improve the quality and productivity 
of farming. In this application, sensors gather different types of 
data (i.e., humidity, carbon dioxide level, and temperature) in 
real-time scenarios. Thus, data gathering, transmission, and rapid 
response to new circumstances require a secured data mechanism to 
avoid malicious adversaries. Therefore, this paper focuses on data 
security from the data origin source to the end-user, and proposes a 
general data security model that is independent of the network 
topology and structure, and can be widely used in the agriculture 
monitoring application. The developed model considers practical 
aspects, the architecture of the sensor node, as well as the necessity 
to save energy while ensuring data security, and optimize the model 
through the application of organizational and technical measures. The 
model evaluation is conducted through simulation in terms of energy 
consumption. The result shows that the proposed model ensures good 
data security at the cost of a slight increase in energy consumption 
at receiver and sender nodes, and energy consumption per bit, up to 
2\%, 7\%, and 1.3\%, respectively, due to overhead added for 
authentication in the network.},

    abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is shaped by increasing 
number of low-cost Internet-connected embedded devices that are 
becoming ubiquitous in every aspect of modern life, including safety- 
and privacy-critical application scenarios. Such devices offer limited 
or no security features, creating a large new attack surface. One key 
component in securing these devices is software integrity checking, 
which is typically attained with Remote Attestation (RA). RA is a 
security service that helps in detecting malware-infected IoT devices 
through remotely verifying their internal state by a trusted party. In 
the vast majority of IoT application domains, IoT devices operate in 
swarms or groups to achieve common tasks. Existing swarm attestation 
techniques are still rigid and not smart enough to address 
heterogeneity and adapt the different requirements of various IoT 
devices connected to a swarm, thus triggering the need for more 
efficient swarm attestation schemes.In this article, we present WISE, 
the first intelligent swarm attestation scheme that takes into account 
the various characteristics, differences, and requirements of 
connected devices in a swarm, aiming at minimizing the communication 
overhead while preserving an adequate level of security. WISE depends 
on a resource-efficient smart broadcast authentication scheme where 
devices are organized in fine-grained multi-clusters, and whenever 
needed, the most likely compromised devices are attested. The 
candidate devices are selected intelligently taking into account the 
attestation history and diverse characteristics and constraints of 
each device in the swarm. We show that WISE is suitable for 
resource-constrained embedded devices, highly efficient and scalable 
in static and dynamic heterogeneous IoT networks, and offers an 
adjustable level of security.},

help identify individuals based on writing style. We incorporated a

    abstract = {More than a whole cycle of the chinese zodiac has 
elapsed since the special issue of Social Research, "China in 
Transition," was published in 2006. After 12 years, China's transition 
is not towards democracy but towards a kind of neo-totalitarianism. 
During this period, Liu Xiaobo, who had written in that issue on the 
growing influence of civil society, was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize 
and died in prison, while his wife was placed under house arrest for 
almost a decade. The year 2008 was a watershed, as the financial 
crisis dealt a serious blow to the Washington Consensus, while the 
successful organization of the Olympic Games by Beijing impressed the 
world. The Chinese leadership used this opportunity to become more 
assertive on the international scene, presenting its regime as a 
credible alternative to Western democracy and the market economy that 
had led the world to an unprecedented crisis. Liu Xiaobo's dream of a 
strong civil society capable of putting an end to the Communist 
Party's dictatorship has vanished. Donald Trump's election, the 
success of populist candidates in Central and Eastern Europe, and the 
advent of a coalition government in Italy that includes the far right 
have dealt a further blow to liberal democracy: Francis Fukuyama's 
expectation of "the end of history" has faded. Whereas in the wake of 
the demise of the Soviet Union, there had been an attempt at 
reconstructing an international order according to the principles of 
democracy and multilateralism, since the beginning of the twenty-first 
century, conflicts have multiplied,multilateralism has lost its 
luster, and the rise of nationalism in many parts of the world has 
challenged the mere idea of an international community. The ascents to 
power of Vladimir Putin in Russia, Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Turkey, and 
Viktor Orb{\'a}n in Hungary have signaled the rise of a new era of 
authoritarianism. Xi Jinping's rule is one of the best examples of 
this new trend. Since Xi became the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) head 
in 2012, the international situation has been very favorable for 
China. Trump's decision to withdraw from the leadership of the Western 
world in order to "make America great again" has paved the way for 
Xi's achievement of the "China Dream" (Zhongguo meng)---an appeal to 
patriotism with the promise that he would restore China's position in 
the world. Putting an end to Deng Xiaoping's foreign policy, which 
consisted in China biding its time, Xi has adopted a proactive 
attitude in order to establish an international order more favorable 
to his country's interests. While Trump was denouncing globalization 
and multilateralism, the leader of the world's second largest economy 
presented himself as the champion of open markets and free trade, 
attracting the support of Europe and Canada (Xi 2017a). Since his 
ascent to power, he has developed relations with many African nations, 
organizing summits with heads of state (the latest in September 2018) 
and opening a military base in Djibouti. His major foreign policy 
initiative, the equivalent of his China Dream on the international 
scene, has been the launch of the Belt and Road initiative, the goal 
of which is to put China back at the center of the world. It consists 
of huge (at least nominally) infrastructure projects, especially 
(high-speed) railways, which are supposed to promote development and 
trade between Central Asia, Africa, and Europe. "Beijing consensus," 
"Chinese model," "Chinese solution"---Xi's leadership has gone to 
great lengths to popularize his mixture of state capitalism and 
authoritarianism (even neo-totalitarianism) as a solution to the 
quandary of development. The People's Republic has thus achieved an 
impressive degree of success, especially in Africa. Since 2008, not 
only has China become the second largest economy in the world, but it 
has also begun to assert itself as a great power (Economy 2018), 
extending its influence beyond its immediate geographical environment, 
developing an increasingly strong navy, and playing an important role 
in the resolution of the conflicts that shake the world. Its positions 
on the environment, on world peace, on a new type of international 
relations carry more and more weight. Beijing's place on the world 
scene has grown in proportion to the decline of the idealists' world 
order. The international climate, characterized by the rise of 
authoritarianism and the decline of the human rights factor in 
international relations, has favored the new leader of China's 
tendencies to establish a type of neo-totalitarianism.},

    abstract = {Attacks based on power analysis have been long 
existing and studied, with some recent works focused on data 
exfiltration from victim systems without using conventional 
communications (e.g., WiFi). Nonetheless, prior works typically rely 
on intrusive direct power measurement, either by implanting meters in 
the power outlet or tapping into the power cable, thus jeopardizing 
the stealthiness of attacks. In this paper, we propose NoDE (Noise for 
Data Exfiltration), a new system for stealthy data exfiltration from 
enterprise desktop computers. Specifically, NoDE achieves data 
exfiltration over a building's power network by exploiting 
high-frequency voltage ripples (i.e., switching noises) generated by 
power factor correction circuits built into today's computers. Located 
at a distance and even from a different room, the receiver can 
non-intrusively measure the voltage of a power outlet to capture the 
high-frequency switching noises for online information decoding 
without supervised training/learning. To evaluate NoDE, we run 
experiments on seven different computers from top vendors and using 
top-brand power supply units. Our results show that for a single 
transmitter, NoDE achieves a rate of up to 28.48 bits/second with a 
distance of 90 feet (27.4 meters) without the line of sight, 
demonstrating a practically stealthy threat. Based on the 
orthogonality of switching noise frequencies of different computers, 
we also demonstrate simultaneous data exfiltration from four computers 
using only one receiver. Finally, we present a few possible defenses, 
such as installing noise filters, and discuss their limitations.},

    abstract = {The employment of modern technologies is widespread in 
our society, so the inclusion of practical activities for education 
has become essential and useful at the same time. These activities are 
more noticeable in Engineering, in areas such as cybersecurity, data 
science, artificial intelligence, etc. Additionally, these activities 
acquire even more relevance with a distance education methodology, as 
our case is. The inclusion of these practical activities has clear 
advantages, such as (1) promoting critical thinking and (2) improving 
students{\rq} abilities and skills for their professional careers. 
There are several options, such as the use of remote and virtual 
laboratories, virtual reality and game-based platforms, among others. 
This work addresses the development of a new cloud game-based 
educational platform, which defines a modular and flexible 
architecture (using light containers). This architecture provides 
interactive and monitoring services and data storage in a transparent 
way. The platform uses gamification to integrate the game as part of 
the instructional process. The CyberScratch project is a particular 
implementation of this architecture focused on cybersecurity 
game-based activities. The data privacy management is a critical issue 
for these kinds of platforms, so the architecture is designed with 
this feature integrated in the platform components. To achieve this 
goal, we first focus on all the privacy aspects for the data generated 
by our cloud game-based platform, by considering the European legal 
context for data privacy following GDPR and ISO/IEC TR 20748-1:2016 
recommendations for Learning Analytics (LA). Our second objective is 
to provide implementation guidelines for efficient data privacy 
management for our cloud game-based educative platform. All these 
contributions are not found in current related works. The CyberScratch 
project, which was approved by UNED for the year 2020, considers using 
the xAPI standard for data handling and services for the game editor, 
game engine and game monitor modules of CyberScratch. Therefore, apart 
from considering GDPR privacy and LA recommendations, our cloud 
game-based architecture covers all phases from game creation to the 
final users{\rq} interactions with the game.},

    abstract = {The sooner disruptive emergent behaviors are detected, 
the sooner preventive measures can be taken to ensure the resilience 
of business processes execution. Therefore, organizations need to 
prepare for emergent behaviors by embedding corrective control 
mechanisms, which help coordinate organization-wide behavior (and 
goals) with the behavior of local autonomous entities. Ongoing 
technological advances, brought by the Industry 4.0 and cyber-physical 
systems of systems paradigms, can support integration within complex 
enterprises, such as supply chains. In this paper, we propose a 
reference enterprise architecture for the detection and monitoring of 
emergent behaviors in enterprises. We focus on addressing the need for 
an adequate reaction to disruptions. Based on a systematic review of 
the literature on the topic of current architectural designs for 
understanding emergent behaviors, we distill architectural 
requirements. Our architecture is a hybrid as it combines distributed 
autonomous business logic (expressed in terms of simple business 
rules) and some central control mechanisms. We exemplify the 
instantiation and use of this architecture by means of a 
proof-of-concept implementation, using a multimodal logistics case 
study. The obtained results provide a basis for achieving supply chain 
resilience ``by design'', i.e., through the design of coordination 
mechanisms that are well equipped to absorb and compensate for the 
effects of emergent disruptive behaviors.},

    abstract = {Information systems of companies and organizations are 
increasingly designed using web services that allow different 
applications written in different programming languages to 
communicate. These systems or some parts of them are often outsourced 
on the cloud, first to leverage the benefits of cloud platforms (e.g., 
scalability) and also to reduce operational costs of companies as 
well. However, web services as well as cloud platforms may be the 
target of attacks that alter their security, and the security of web 
services is not completely addressed. The solutions proposed in the 
literature are sometimes specific to certain types of attacks and they 
cannot ensure the attack tolerance of web services. Attack tolerance 
can be defined as the capability of a system to function properly with 
minimal degradation of performance, even if the presence of an attack 
is detected. As such, we claim that, to achieve attack tolerance, one 
should detect attacks by a continuous monitoring and mitigate the 
effects of these attacks by reliable reaction mechanisms. For this 
aim, an attack tolerance framework is proposed in this paper. This 
framework includes the risks analysis of attacks and is based on 
diversification and software reflection techniques. We applied this 
framework to cloud applications that are based on web services. After 
describing the core foundation of this approach, we express such cloud 
applications as choreographies of web services according to their 
distributed nature. The framework has been validated through an 
electronic voting system. The results of these experiments show the 
capability of the framework to ensure the required attack tolerance of 
cloud applications.},

    abstract = {As the world enters a fourth Industrial Revolution, 
organizations worldwide face challenges in dealing with important 
assets such as industrial technology. Leaking these assets can not 
only damage organizations economically but also negatively affect 
customer relationships and brand image. This has led to an increased 
awareness of industrial security in both the business and academic 
spheres and a focus on identifying and implementing countermeasures 
against security incidents, as future computing environments will 
continuously face security threats. This study first examines the 
literature on industrial security and its current status in South 
Korea, which is considered an active industrial security research 
environment. Subsequently, meta-analyses are conducted on South Korea 
and abroad to compare their status and research trends in the 
industrial security field. The results confirm that South Korea has 
more actively conducted relevant studies compared to international 
research. This study contributes to the current literature by not only 
increasing the awareness of industrial security but also encouraging 
future studies in the field to facilitate a safe and sustainable 
computing environment.},

have the potential to assist healthcare professionals when working and 
help to increase the well-being of the people. These devices comprise 
the Internet of Medical Things, but it is generally difficult for 
healthcare institutions to meet compliance of their systems with new 
medical solutions efficiently. A technology that promises the sharing 
of data in a trust-less scenario is the Distributed Ledger Technology 
through its properties of decentralization, immutability, and 
transparency. The Blockchain and the Internet of Medical Things can be 
considered as at an early stage, and the implementations successfully 
applying the technology are not so many. Some aspects covered by these 
implementations are data sharing, interoperability of systems, 
security of devices, the opportunity of data monetization and data 
ownership that will be the focus of this review. This work aims at 
giving an overview of the current state-of-the-art of the 
Blockchain-based systems for the Internet of Medical Things, 
specifically addressing the challenges of reaching user-centricity for 
these combined systems, and thus highlighting the potential future 
directions to follow for full ownership of data by users.},

    abstract = {Treatment Improvement Protocols (TIPs) are developed 
by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration 
(SAMHSA) within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. TIPs 
are best practice guidelines for the treatment of substance use 
disorders. TIPs draw on the experience and knowledge of clinical, 
research, and administrative experts to evaluate the quality and 
appropriateness of various forms of treatment. Although each TIP 
strives to include an evidence base for the practices it recommends, 
SAMHSA recognizes that the field of substance abuse treatment is 
continually evolving, and research frequently lags behind the 
innovations pioneered in the field. Historically, standard behavioral 
health services for substance abuse have been designed with male 
clients in mind. As the number of women presenting for substance abuse 
services increased, clinicians began to understand that women had 
different treatment needs than men, related to differences in their 
patterns of substance use and their perceptions of both the problem of 
substance abuse and its treatment.},

    abstract = {In the Renaissance, these collections of textual 
fragments culled by readers from a myriad of sources were embraced as 
memory aids and as rich storehouses of materials that might eventually 
be incorporated into composition of one's own making.3 Although blogs 
are sometimes described as digital diaries, like commonplace books, 
their contents are often primarily or entirely comprised of images and 
texts culled from other sources. While theorizing on the archive 
remains deeply inflected by Foucault's early writings, Derrida's 
Archive Fever, published in French and English in 1995, has become a 
central point of reference for theorizing on the archive across the 
disciplines.5 This, however, is somewhat surprising, since Archive 
Fever is not necessarily about the archive, but as historian Caroline 
Steedman observes, a "sustained contemplation of a work of history.\n

    abstract = {By law, schools are required to protect the well-being 
of students against problems such as on-campus bullying and physical 
abuse. In the UK, a report by the Office for Education (OfE) showed 
17\% of young people had been bullied during 2017--2018. This problem 
continues to prevail with consequences including depression, anxiety, 
suicidal thoughts, and eating disorders. Additionally, recent evidence 
suggests this type of victimisation could intensify existing health 
complications. This study investigates the opportunities provided by 
Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) data towards next-generation 
safeguarding. A new model is developed based on blockchain technology 
to enable real-time intervention triggered by IoMT data that can be 
used to detect stressful events, e.g., when bullying takes place. The 
model utilises private permissioned blockchain to manage IoMT data to 
achieve quicker and better decision-making while revolutionising 
aspects related to compliance, double-entry, confidentiality, and 
privacy. The feasibility of the model and the interaction between the 
sensors and the blockchain was simulated. To facilitate a close 
approximation of an actual IoMT environment, we clustered and 
decomposed existing medical sensors to their attributes, including 
their function, for a variety of scenarios. Then, we demonstrated the 
performance and capabilities of the emulator under different loads of 
sensor-generated data. We argue to the suitability of this emulator 
for schools and medical centres to conduct feasibility studies to 
address sensor data with disruptive data processing and management 
technologies.},

    abstract = {This article examines demographic research on child 
pornography offenders and considers its utility for sentencing reform. 
It begins by tracing the history of the Internet and federal 
possession law, detailing particularly how public and political panic 
about child pornography evolved within a growing fear of the Internet 
itself. The article continues by surveying current demographic 
research on possession offenders. Drawing on this data and related 
research, the article considers what the literature can contribute to 
sentencing policy, simultaneously showcasing vast differences between 
the type of offender Congress intended to punish and those actually 
receiving the harsh punishment. Taken wholly, this article explains 
why child pornography guidelines represent a departure from the normal 
process of creating Federal Sentencing Guidelines; it tells how law 
succumbed to the forces of fear and stacked the scale against child 
pornography offenders. PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

    abstract = {The emergence of anti-social behaviour in online 
environments presents a serious issue in today{\rq}s society. 
Automatic detection and identification of such behaviour are becoming 
increasingly important. Modern machine learning and natural language 
processing methods can provide effective tools to detect different 
types of anti-social behaviour from the pieces of text. In this work, 
we present a comparison of various deep learning models used to 
identify the toxic comments in the Internet discussions. Our main goal 
was to explore the effect of the data preparation on the model 
performance. As we worked with the assumption that the use of 
traditional pre-processing methods may lead to the loss of 
characteristic traits, specific for toxic content, we compared several 
popular deep learning and transformer language models. We aimed to 
analyze the influence of different pre-processing techniques and text 
representations including standard TF-IDF, pre-trained word embeddings 
and also explored currently popular transformer models. Experiments 
were performed on the dataset from the Kaggle Toxic Comment 
Classification competition, and the best performing model was compared 
with the similar approaches using standard metrics used in data 
analysis.},

    abstract = {The rising automation level and development of the 
Industry 4.0 concept in the mining sector increase the risk of 
cyber-attacks. As a result, this article focuses on developing a risk 
analysis method that integrates Kaplan{\rq}s and Garrick{\rq}s 
approach and fuzzy theory. The proposed approach takes into account 
the level of automation of the operating mining processes. Moreover, 
it follows five main steps, including identifying the automation level 
in a selected mine, definition of cyber-attack targets, identification 
of cyber-attack techniques, definition of cyber-attack consequences, 
and risk ratio assessment. The proposed risk assessment procedure was 
performed according to three cyber-attack targets (databases, internal 
networks, machinery) and seven selected types of cyber-attack 
techniques. The fuzzy theory is implemented in risk parameter 
estimation for cyber-attack scenario occurrence in the mining 
industry. To illustrate the given method{\rq}s applicability, seven 
scenarios for three levels of mine automation are analyzed. The 
proposed method may be used to reveal the current cybersecurity status 
of the mine. Moreover, it will be a valuable guide for mines in which 
automation is planned in the near future.},

    abstract = {Iceland has been slow in developing a national 
security concept, for reasons that include a long period of reliance 
on US protection post-World War Two, and divided internal views over 
this defence solution. Since the withdrawal of all US stationed forces 
in 2006, Iceland's security partnerships have diversified and attempts 
have been made to frame security in more multi-functional terms. The 
Risk Assessment Report of 2009 made important progress in itemizing 
non-military threats and risks. On this basis, a cross-party 
parliamentary committee was invited to start work in 2012 on 
guidelines for a security strategy. Its report, published in March 
2014, establishes a large area of consensus on 'softer' security 
issues and on remaining in NATO, with a few dissenting voices on the 
latter. Its main omission is a proper treatment of economic and 
financial security, still tied to the divisive issue of EU membership. 
Meanwhile, Iceland's recent security experience in 2014 has helped to 
highlight the reality of both harder and softer security challenges. 
The government can now proceed to draft a full official security 
strategy, to be laid before parliament possibly in 2015.},

colleges and high schools, Farris explains, many high school teachers 
have no clear sense of the college-level literacy for which they are 
preparing their students. ...] Farris notes that while college 
instructors tend to assume (although usually without saying so 
explicitly, or with any consistency) that students will master various 
disciplinary conventions and enter into scholarly conversations, high 
school writing instructors (although again without complete 
consistency) tend to encourage students to read literature for 
enjoyment, to write personal essays, and to use correct grammar and 
punctuation.\n Survey results suggest that colleges want students to 
have mastered fewer but more in-depth fundamental skills, while high 
schools are covering a broader range of topics. National Writing

    abstract = {The symposium on "Generating Respect for the Law: An 
Appraisal" brought together experts from various disciplines, 
including law, political science, government, philosophy, history, 
humanitarian action, the military and academia, from across Australia. 
Over the course of two days, these experts considered several 
questions: How have perceptions of international humanitarian law 
(IHL) evolved over time, and where do we now stand? What are the 
challenges raised by transnational asymmetric armed conflict? How 
should armed groups who do not accept the constraints of IHL be 
approached? What roles should States, academics and civil society play 
in generating respect for the law? And lastly, how does new technology 
change the face of contemporary warfare? Several conclusions can be 
drawn from the resulting discussion. Most importantly, the law alone 
is not enough to change behaviour on the battlefield.},

    abstract = {A tour of the theoretical development and the main 
research lines of international communication is presented. To do 
this, the appearance of communication in the configuration of power in 
four aspects (hard, soft, sharp and strategic narrative) is analyzed. 
The critical perspective and the Anglo-Saxon mastery on the subject 
are examined, with evidence from France, Germany, or Latin America. 
Five axes of future research are anticipated, such as the 
strengthening of the theoretical and methodological bases with 
interdisciplinary methods; the nature and characteristics of the 
international journalists (correspondents versus false news); the 
management of populist communication in the face of a political 
globalization with leaders that hinder the conventional journalistic 
ethos; the analysis of the structures; and global information systems 
in a multipolar scenario and less ``CNN effect'' than expected, and 
the constant innovation dynamics of propaganda.},

    abstract = {In South Asia, Pakistan is in a situation to prevent 
the growth of terrorist activities. In this context we need to 
identify and define certain important components of terrorism and some 
worth mentioning characteristics of terrorists which have greater 
imperative of the new phenomenon of globalization of terrorism. The 
immediate effects of all terrorist activities are felt and dealt at a 
local level by the native LEAs and other institutions responsible for 
disaster management. We know that there are definitional difficulties 
in explaining what terrorism is, however, lack of the constraints of 
definitional consensus doesn't mean that common characteristics of 
terrorist activities within the existing definitions of terrorism 
don't exist. This applies to all kinds of terrorism, the list of which 
is generally found in every relevant literature. The present paper is 
an attempt to identify the potential terrorist activities in Pakistan 
from policing perspective and analyses the problems and implications 
for Law enforcement. PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

leading the Non-Aligned Movement, Group of 77, playing an active role

issues, such as disarmament, North-South Dialogue, and various trade 
negotiations. The USA believed that it could redo the map of West 
Asia, obtain control of its oil and gas resources, and bring about 
democratic change in the wake of its belief that the political and 
economic values - those of democracy and the market economy - that it 
espoused as a nation had been validated by its victory in the Cold War 
and were ready for spreading world-wide as an integral part of US 
foreign policy. After the demise of the Soviet Union and the end of 
the Cold War, the USA began promoting democracy and the market economy 
world-wide through "coloured revolutions" in areas of geopolitical 
sensitivity, including the encouragement of the "Arab Spring". The USA 
believed that opening the world market, especially that of the USA, to 
an economically reforming China would, along with building prosperity 
there, create a middle class that would demand political reforms and a 
greater say in governance, leading to a democratic China with stakes 
in the preservation of the existing international order in which the 
USA would remain the pre-eminent power.},

    abstract = {With the introduction of Industry 4.0, and smart 
factories accordingly, there are new opportunities to implement 
elements of industry 4.0 in nonthermal processing. Moreover, with 
application of Internet of things (IoT), smart control of the process, 
big data optimization, as well as sustainable production and 
monitoring, there is a new era of Internet of nonthermal food 
processing technologies (IoNTP). Nonthermal technologies include high 
power ultrasound, pulsed electric fields, high voltage electrical 
discharge, high pressure processing, UV-LED, pulsed light, e-beam, and 
advanced thermal food processing techniques include microwave 
processing, ohmic heating and high-pressure homogenization. The aim of 
this review was to bring in front necessity to evaluate possibilities 
of implementing smart sensors, artificial intelligence (AI), big data, 
additive technologies with nonthermal technologies, with the 
possibility to create smart factories together with strong emphasis on 
sustainability. This paper brings an overview on digitalization, IoT, 
additive technologies (3D printing), cloud data storage and smart 
sensors including two SWOT analysis associated with IoNTPs and 
sustainability. It is of high importance to perform life cycle 
assessment (LCA), to quantify (En)---environmental dimension; 
(So)---social dimension and (Ec)---economic dimension. SWOT analysis 
showed: potential for energy saving during food processing; optimized 
overall environmental performance; lower manufacturing cost; 
development of eco-friendly products; higher level of health and 
safety during food processing and better work condition for workers. 
Nonthermal and advanced thermal technologies can be applied also as 
sustainable techniques working in line with the sustainable 
development goals (SDGs) and Agenda 2030 issued by United Nations 
(UN).},

    abstract = {In Facebook groups of young Moroccan non-believers, 
cartoons, memes, and jokes that mock religion are widely shared. By 
phrasing the messages in a humorous way, it is possible to express 
experiences and viewpoints that are more difficult to communicate in 
direct speech. Studying these forms of humor can reveal several 
themes, frames, and tropes that are important to many former Muslims, 
such as criticizing the legal restrictions of non-belief and 
countering stereotypes about non-believers. This leads to the 
following question: To what extent is humor being employed as an 
(online) tool for young Moroccan non-believers to challenge the 
religious status quo? To answer this question, the article analyzes 
numerous examples of religious-related humor during the COVID-19 
pandemic and Ramadan. Hereby, it becomes clear that many jokes remain 
a limited and covert dissent strategy, as they are only shared among 
fellow non-believers. Yet, this article argues that jokes are an 
important method of differentiation, self-expression, and in-group 
identification that can build a fruitful ground for future activism.},

by pandemics required a global cooperation. The problem of global 
cooperation has two aspects. First,is that member States are not

    abstract = {...]we seek to generate a wider discussion in the 
field regarding a revised approach to this threat that is situated 
within a global framework of collaborative law enforcement which 
incorporates, in appropriate fashion, certain military and 
counter-terrorist strategies. The propositions we advance in support 
of a revised approach to countering transnational crime and its 
globalized web-enabled criminals include: (a) terrorism is one species 
of transnational crime; (b) the criminal justice model of arrest, 
prosecution, conviction and incarceration is a partial and 
insufficient response to transnational crime; (c) national security 
and law enforcement functions should be viewed analytically as a 
``public security'' continuum rather than disciplines separated by 
bright lines; (d) countering transnational criminal organizations 
effectively may require development of a hybrid law 
enforcement/military capacity and new strategic and tactical 
doctrines, including safeguards against abuse, to govern its 
deployment; (e) joint border management within nations and between 
them, coordinated with the private sector, is required and 
inter-agency cooperation and multilateral institutions must be 
strengthened in accordance with new international norms and (f) North 
America, a region construed as extending from Colombia to the Arctic 
and from Bermuda to Hawaii, could develop in the future, together with 
the European Union, as an initial site for a model pilot of the new 
approach. The United States National Security Council (roughly) 
estimates $1.3 Trillion to $3.3 Trillion is involved in money 
laundering perpetrated by transnational criminal enterprises; $750 
Billion to $1 Trillion in narcotics trafficking; $170 Billion to $320 
Billion in illicit firearms trafficking; $21 Billion in human 
trafficking; $500 Billion in counterfeit and pirated goods; $20 to $40 
Billion in environmental crimes including illegal wildlife trade; and 
$10 to $12 Billion in fraudulent credit card transactions. In the 
period since the end of the Cold War -- one of transition to a new 
series of geopolitical rivalries and relationships -- transnational 
criminal activity has increased significantly and the non-state 
organizations involved have grown correspondingly in power and 
influence.},

    abstract = {The internet is an area where young people establish 
relationships and develop socially, emotionally and morally, but it 
also gives rise to certain forms of online behaviour, such as 
cybergossip, which are associated with cyberaggression and other risky 
behaviour. The aims of this study were to verify whether a 
longitudinal association exists between cybergossip and 
cyberaggression, and to discover which mechanisms of moral 
disengagement may mediate this relationship. The final sample 
consisted of 1392 students (50\% girls; Mage = 13.47; SD = 0.77), who 
were surveyed in a three-wave longitudinal study at six-month 
intervals. The results obtained confirmed a direct, positive 
relationship between cybergossip, subsequent cyberaggression and the 
mediation exerted by cognitive restructuring in this transition. We 
discuss the importance of recognizing and detecting the fine 
distinction between online gossip and cyberaggression with the 
intention of doing harm, and focus on the justifications used by young 
people to normalize online bullying. To sum up, there is a clear need 
to encourage ethical, responsible behaviour in online interactions in 
order to achieve well-balanced, more sustainable relationships in 
classrooms.},

    abstract = {This article investigates religious transformations in 
contemporary Turkey through the case of women{\rq}s unveiling. Drawing 
on 10 in-depth interviews with university-educated urban women who 
have recently stopped wearing the veil, the article examines their 
experiences and their motivations for unveiling. It asks to what 
extent and in what ways Muslim women{\rq}s decisions to unveil are a 
reaction against the ruling Justice and Development Party{\rq}s (AKP) 
shift towards electoral authoritarianism and Islamic conservatism. 
Some practicing Muslims, particularly youth, have withdrawn their 
support from the government because of its political authoritarianism 
and its abandonment of Islamic ideals relating to justice. Since the 
2013 Gezi Park protests, the AKP has come under critical scrutiny, 
both economically (e.g., increasing youth unemployment rates, widening 
income inequality, the shrinking middle class, clientelism) and 
sociopolitically (e.g., gendered social welfare policies, pro-natalist 
campaigns, the discourse on creating a pious generation). However, 
although the current political atmosphere plays a significant role in 
women{\rq}s unveiling, the article also discusses women{\rq}s personal 
and theological motives. The article elaborates on how ex-hijabi women 
contest both Islamist politics and Islamic orthodoxy regarding female 
religiosity and how these women reinterpret dominant gender norms.},

provided to the information operations planner for synchronizing their 
efforts with the overall Joint Planning Group. The analysis shows that 
while doctrine often calls for "more cowbell," seldom does it explain 
how to incorporate such measures into the overall plan. To develop an 
integrated, synchronized information operations plan, this analysis 
suggests a four-step process based on systems analysis to achieve 
unity of effort; gain synergies throughout the joint planning process; 
and avoid unintended consequences, information fratricide, and 
strategic surprise. Therefore, in addition to the proposed 
recommendations, several areas for further research related to joint 
planning and the integration of information operations into the 
planning process are also provided.},

direction of the future vehicular development, automotive security 
plays an increasingly important role in the whole car industry chain. 
On condition that the accompanying problems of security are proofed, 
vehicles will provide more convenience while ensuring safety. Security 
models can be utilized as tools to rationalize the security of the 
automotive system and represent it in a structured manner. It is 
essential to improve the knowledge about security models by comparing 
them besides proposing new methods. This paper aims to give a 
comprehensive introduction to the topic of security models for the 
Intelligent Transport System (ITS). A survey of the current 
methodologies for security modeling is conducted and a classification 
scheme is subsequently proposed. Furthermore, the existing framework 
and methods to build automotive security models are broadly examined 
according to the features of automotive electronic system. A number of 
fundamental aspects are defined to compare the presented methods in 
order to comprehend the automotive security modeling in depth.},

    abstract = {Current Peer-to-Peer (P2P) energy market models raise 
serious concerns regarding the confidentiality and integrity of energy 
consumption, trading and billing data. While Distributed Ledger 
Technology (DLT) systems (e.g., blockchain) have been proposed to 
enhance security, an attacker could damage other parts of the model, 
such as its infrastructure: an adversarial attacker could target the 
communication between entities by, e.g., eavesdropping or modifying 
data. The main goal of this paper is to propose a model for a 
decentralised P2P marketplace for trading energy, which addresses the 
problem of developing security and privacy-aware environments. 
Additionally, a Multi-Agent System (MAS) architecture is presented 
with a focus on security and sustainability. In order to propose a 
solution to DLT{\rq}s scalability issues (i.e., through transaction 
confirmation delays), off-chain state channels are considered for the 
energy negotiation and resolution processes. Additionally, a STRIDE 
(spoofing, tampering, repudiation, information disclosure, denial of 
service, elevation of privilege) security analysis is conducted within 
the context of the proposed model to identify potential 
vulnerabilities.},

    abstract = {Big data and online media conglomerates have 
significant power over the behavior of individuals. Online platforms 
have become the largest canvas for advertising, and the most 
profitable commodity is users{\rq} attention. Large tech companies, 
such as Facebook and Alphabet, use historically effective 
psychological advertisement tactics in tandem with enormous amounts of 
user data to effectively and efficiently meet the needs of their 
customers, who are not the end-users, but the corporations competing 
for advertising space on users{\rq} screens. This commodification of 
attention is a serious threat to socio-ecological sustainability. In 
this paper, I argue that big data and social advertising platforms, 
such as Facebook, use commodified attention to take advantage of 
psycho-social neuroticisms and commodity fetishism in modern 
individuals to perpetuate conspicuous consumption. They also

    abstract = {In an ever-evolving technological industry, the oil 
and gas sector is already moving forward through the adaptation of 
Industry 4.0 and the adaptation of advanced cyber technologies through 
Oil and Gas 4.0. As IT/OT (information technology/operational 
technology) systems are evolving technologically, so are the cyber 
security threats faced by the offshore oil and gas assets. This paper 
aims to raise the awareness of cyber security threats and the 
organizational and technical measures that need to be adopted by the 
oil and gas industry for remote and complex assets in the upstream 
sector. A comprehensive literature review covering the areas of new 
IT/OT systems integration and cyber security risk analysis and 
management is presented. The results of a survey on the subject of 
cyber security for offshore oil and gas assets are also presented, and 
they provide valuable insight into the current industry culture and 
the perception of cyber security concepts. The importance of 
organizational culture, personnel training and involvement, as well as 
corporate engagement and support in the subject of cyber security is 
highlighted.},

    abstract = {The use of mobile phones has great benefits for 
communication. However, evidence has shown that problematic use, such 
as cyberbullying, can also be associated with mobile phones. In this 
sense, emotional regulation plays an important role. The objective of 
this study was to identify different groups that varied in terms of 
conflicts related to problematic mobile phone use (namely, maladaptive 
communication and emotional patterns). Furthermore, the study aimed to 
examine whether there were significant differences in the dimensions 
of emotional intelligence and cyberbullying between adolescents with a 
mobile phone use problem. The study participants were 810 students 
aged between 12 and 16 years. The Emotional Coefficient Inventory 
questionnaire about cyberbullying and a questionnaire on experiences 
related to mobile phones were used. The cluster analysis identified 
three different types of mobile phone use: A group displaying no 
problematic use, a group displaying moderately problematic use, and a 
group displaying problematic use. The study results motivate carrying 
out stress management programs, emotional re-education, and other 
actions that reinforce emotional intelligence.},

    abstract = {Since the advent of the second digital revolution, the 
exponential advancement of technology is shaping a world with new 
social, economic, political, technological, and legal circumstances. 
The consequential disruptions force governments and societies to seek 
ways for their cities to become more humane, ethical, inclusive, 
intelligent, and sustainable. In recent years, the concept of 
City-as-a-Platform was coined with the hope of providing an innovative 
approach for addressing the aforementioned disruptions. Today, this 
concept is rapidly gaining popularity, as more and more platform 
thinking applications become available to the city context---so-called 
platform urbanism. These platforms used for identifying and addressing 
various urbanization problems with the assistance of open data, 
participatory innovation opportunity, and collective knowledge. With 
these developments in mind, this study aims to tackle the question of 
``How can platform urbanism support local governance efforts in the 
development of smarter cities?'' Through an integrative review of 
journal articles published during the last decade, the evolution of 
City-as-a-Platform was analyzed. The findings revealed the prospects 
and constraints for the realization of transformative and disruptive 
impacts on the government and society through the platform urbanism, 
along with disclosing the opportunities and challenges for smarter 
urban development governance with collective knowledge through 
platform urbanism.},

revolution, digital technologies such as artificial intelligence, 
machine learning, the Internet of Things, Big Data, Blockchain, 
Robotics, 3D technologies, and many more have become the means and 
solutions to many of the world{\rq}s problems. Most recently, these 
technologies have assisted in the global fight of the COVID-19 
pandemic and other societal problems. Together with these innovative 
techniques, the concept of circular economy and its relevant tools 
such as life cycle costing, life cycle impact assessment, materials 
passports, and circularity measurements have been implemented in a 
number of sectors in different countries for the transition from a 
linear ``take, make, and dispose'' model towards a more circular 
model, which has shown positive results for the environment and 
economy. In this article, with the help of implementation, 
prototyping, and case studies, we explore how these technological 
advancements and innovative techniques are used in different sectors 
such as information and communications technology, the built 
environment, mining and manufacturing, education, healthcare, the 
public sectors, and others to provide an opportunity to understand and 
resolve the agreed upon framework in 2015 by 193 countries, that is, 
the 17 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.},

    abstract = {In the context of the digital transformation of the 
European economy and society, new technologies have emerged bringing 
new opportunities for the benefit of citizens, public administrations 
and businesses. One of these is the Blockchain-based smart contracts 
rooted in what is known as Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs). 
This article aims to provide an overview of how DLTs could be 
successfully implemented in the governance of public procurement, as 
well as discussing some legal challenges that might appear. Taking 
into account the proof of concept of all the existing projects in this 
field, DLTs promise to provide procuring with a high level of 
transparency, integrity, autonomy, and overall speed-up procurement 
cycles. While the architecture of a Blockchain-based public 
procurement scheme is constrained by the immaturity of the technology, 
it is observed that the establishment of private ledgers (or 
public-permissioned ledgers) in tender procedures might be more 
suitable to public procurement. Although the process of implementation 
might be costly and less feasible in comparison with other fields in 
the public sector, initiatives focusing on this area should be 
endorsed. Ultimately, the successful implementation of DLTs in the 
governance of public procurement is inconceivable without a 
far-reaching professionalisation of procurement practitioners.

    abstract = {Introduction The title of this conference is 
``Violence and Peace in Our Times.'' The reason we chose this is 
because 9.11 was a shock that woke us all from the sense of boundless 
optimism with which we greeted the Third Millennium. Ever since the 
dawn of history, man has lived with violence. Even in our socalled 
{\lq}civilized{\rq} age, we have lived with violence, both major and 
minor. With the fall of Communism, the violence of the ``Liberation 
Front'' has been weakened only to be succeeded by ``racial cleansing'' 
of Kosovo, the genocide of East Timor and then finally 9.11. Of 
course, by violence here, we mean intentional violence perpetrated 
through overt, physical acts. {\lq}Even while waging a war every man 
wants peace whereas no one wants war while he is making peace,{\rq} 
said St. Augustine. (omnis enim homo etiam belligerando pacem quaerit: 
nemo autem bellum pacificando. (De Civitate Dei, 19, 12)1 However, 
true peace comes from a peaceful order and the right human order can 
only be based on justice. In this paper, I will be comparing 
St.Thomas{\rq} theories on violence, justice and peace with those of 
Confucianism.},

{author={Gomez-Moreno Jose Manuel Urena},
    abstract = {Image schemas are mental constructs central to human 
cognitive psychology. The neurobiological grounding of these 
structures has been suggested by experimental research both in 
non-human primates (Rizzolatti and Craighero 2004; Umilt{\'a} et al. 
2001) and lower animals (Knudsen 2002, 1998). However, their 
applicability as concrete cognitive products has not been explored yet 
in zoosemiotics. This study shows that image schemas are highly 
instrumental to making sense of the impersonations of two animals 
featured in biology research studies and wildlife documentary films: 
the mimic octopus (Thaumoctopus mimicus) and the Gibb{\rq}s sea spider 
crab (Pisa armata). In analysing the movements and postures of these 
animals, it is argued that image schemas underlie recurring patterns 
of animal bodily experience and response, which ties image-schematic 
structures to non-human intersubjectivity. In line with the 
pluralistic view of zoosemiotics (e.g. Maran, Martinelli and Turovski 
2011), this paper takes an intermediary position in the 
continuity--discontinuity debate regarding communication in humans and 
animals. In this regard, the complexity of the creative behavioural 
models of the animals examined leaves the door open for the existence 
of sophisticated mental life in non-human species.},

    abstract = {Background Hospitals play a vital role in disaster 
stricken regions. The resilient hospitals will be able to provide 
essential services to affected people and it can mitigate the risk of 
injuries during and after disasters. This study aimed to obtain the 
indicators required for the evaluation of hospital resilience. Methods 
This systematic review was conducted in 2018. Through this systematic 
review, international electronic databases were investigated for the 
research studies published in English. The exclusion and inclusion 
criteria were determined to extract the hospital resilience 
indicators. These indicators will be used in order to develop a model 
to keep the system performance at an acceptable level during 
disasters. Results Out of 1794 research studies published until 
September 2018, 89 articles and guidelines with full text were 
surveyed. Thirty-two articles and guidelines were then selected and 
analyzed to collect the indicators related to hospital disaster 
resilience (HDR). The domains and the indicators were extracted from 
these selected research studies. The authors collected and categorized 
them into three domains and twenty seven subdomains. The three domains 
included constructive, infrastructural, and administrative resilience. 
The relevant indicators were designed for each subdomain to assess 
HDR. Conclusion Since diverse indicators affect hospital resilience, 
other studies should be conducted to propose some models or tools to 
quantify the hospital resilience in different countries and scopes 
with an all hazards approach.},

high-profile U.S. political organizations, the Department of Homeland

cyberattacks to influence the U.S. election process. Reports suggest 
that Russia intended to use the hacks and subsequent information dump 
to help then-candidate Donald Trump win the presidential election. In 
response to the cyberattacks, the United States took steps against 
several Russian individuals and entities. The Obama administration 
also initiated an extensive review of Russian involvement in the 
election, which eventually reaffirmed key intelligence conclusions 
regarding the scope of Russian interference. Several congressional

{author={Jean-Philippe Beja},
    abstract = {More than a whole cycle of the chinese zodiac has 
elapsed since the special issue of Social Research, "China in 
Transition," was published in 2006. After 12 years, China's transition 
is not towards democracy but towards a kind of neo-totalitarianism. 
During this period, Liu Xiaobo, who had written in that issue on the 
growing influence of civil society, was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize 
and died in prison, while his wife was placed under house arrest for 
almost a decade. The year 2008 was a watershed, as the financial 
crisis dealt a serious blow to the Washington Consensus, while the 
successful organization of the Olympic Games by Beijing impressed the 
world. The Chinese leadership used this opportunity to become more 
assertive on the international scene, presenting its regime as a 
credible alternative to Western democracy and the market economy that 
had led the world to an unprecedented crisis. Liu Xiaobo's dream of a 
strong civil society capable of putting an end to the Communist 
Party's dictatorship has vanished. Donald Trump's election, the 
success of populist candidates in Central and Eastern Europe, and the 
advent of a coalition government in Italy that includes the far right 
have dealt a further blow to liberal democracy: Francis Fukuyama's 
expectation of "the end of history" has faded. Whereas in the wake of 
the demise of the Soviet Union, there had been an attempt at 
reconstructing an international order according to the principles of 
democracy and multilateralism, since the beginning of the twenty-first 
century, conflicts have multiplied,multilateralism has lost its 
luster, and the rise of nationalism in many parts of the world has 
challenged the mere idea of an international community. The ascents to 
power of Vladimir Putin in Russia, Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Turkey, and 
Viktor Orb{\'a}n in Hungary have signaled the rise of a new era of 
authoritarianism. Xi Jinping's rule is one of the best examples of 
this new trend. Since Xi became the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) head 
in 2012, the international situation has been very favorable for 
China. Trump's decision to withdraw from the leadership of the Western 
world in order to "make America great again" has paved the way for 
Xi's achievement of the "China Dream" (Zhongguo meng)---an appeal to 
patriotism with the promise that he would restore China's position in 
the world. Putting an end to Deng Xiaoping's foreign policy, which 
consisted in China biding its time, Xi has adopted a proactive 
attitude in order to establish an international order more favorable 
to his country's interests. While Trump was denouncing globalization 
and multilateralism, the leader of the world's second largest economy 
presented himself as the champion of open markets and free trade, 
attracting the support of Europe and Canada (Xi 2017a). Since his 
ascent to power, he has developed relations with many African nations, 
organizing summits with heads of state (the latest in September 2018) 
and opening a military base in Djibouti. His major foreign policy 
initiative, the equivalent of his China Dream on the international 
scene, has been the launch of the Belt and Road initiative, the goal 
of which is to put China back at the center of the world. It consists 
of huge (at least nominally) infrastructure projects, especially 
(high-speed) railways, which are supposed to promote development and 
trade between Central Asia, Africa, and Europe. "Beijing consensus," 
"Chinese model," "Chinese solution"---Xi's leadership has gone to 
great lengths to popularize his mixture of state capitalism and 
authoritarianism (even neo-totalitarianism) as a solution to the 
quandary of development. The People's Republic has thus achieved an 
impressive degree of success, especially in Africa. Since 2008, not 
only has China become the second largest economy in the world, but it 
has also begun to assert itself as a great power (Economy 2018), 
extending its influence beyond its immediate geographical environment, 
developing an increasingly strong navy, and playing an important role 
in the resolution of the conflicts that shake the world. Its positions 
on the environment, on world peace, on a new type of international 
relations carry more and more weight. Beijing's place on the world 
scene has grown in proportion to the decline of the idealists' world 
order. The international climate, characterized by the rise of 
authoritarianism and the decline of the human rights factor in 
international relations, has favored the new leader of China's 
tendencies to establish a type of neo-totalitarianism.},
